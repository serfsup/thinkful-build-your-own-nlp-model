      "I learn in this letter that Don Pedro of Arragon comes this night to Messina. He is very near by this: he was not three leagues off when I left him. How many gentlemen have you lost in this action? But few of any sort, and none of name. A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings home full numbers. I find here that Don Pedro hath bestowed much honour on a young Florentine called Claudio. Much deserved on his part and equally remembered by Don Pedro. He hath borne himself beyond the promise of his age, doing in the figure of a lamb the feats of a lion: he hath indeed better bettered expectation than you must expect of me to tell you how. He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much glad of it. I have already delivered him letters, and there appears much joy in him; even so much that joy could not show itself modest enough without a badge of bitterness. Did he break out into tears? In great measure. A kind overflow of kindness. There are no faces truer than those that are so washed: how much better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping! I pray you is Signior Mountanto returned from the wars or no? I know none of that name, lady: there was none such in the army of any sort. What is he that you ask for, niece? My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua. O! he is returned, and as pleasant as ever he was. He set up his bills here in Messina and challenged Cupid at the flight; and my uncle's fool, reading the challenge, subscribed for Cupid, and challenged him at the bird-bolt. I pray you, how many hath he killed and eaten in these wars? But how many hath he killed? for, indeed, I promised to eat all of his killing. Faith, niece, you tax Signior Benedick too much; but he'll be meet with you, I doubt it not. He hath done good service, lady, in these wars. You had musty victual, and he hath holp to eat it: he is a very valiant trencherman; he hath an excellent stomach. And a good soldier too, lady. And a good soldier to a lady; but what is he to a lord? A lord to a lord, a man to a man, stuffed with all honourable virtues. It is so, indeed; he is no less than a stuffed man; but for the stuffing,â€”well, we are all mortal. You must not, sir, mistake my niece There is a kind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick and her: they never meet but there's a skirmish of wit between them. Alas! he gets nothing by that. In our last conflict four of his five wits went halting off, and now is the whole man governed with one! so that if he have wit enough to keep himself warm, let him bear it for a difference between himself and his horse; for it is all the wealth that he hath left to be known a reasonable creature. Who is his companion now? He hath every month a new sworn brother. Is't possible? Very easily possible: he wears his faith but as the fashion of his hat; it ever changes with the next block. I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books. No; an he were, I would burn my study. But, I pray you, who is his companion? Is there no young squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil? He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio. O Lord! he will hang upon him like a disease: he is sooner caught than the pestilence, and the taker runs presently mad. God help the noble Claudio! if he have caught the Benedick, it will cost him a thousand pound ere a' be cured. I will hold friends with you, lady. Do, good friend. You will never run mad, niece. No, not till a hot January. Don Pedro is approached. Good Signior Leonato, you are come to meet your trouble: the fashion of the world is to avoid cost, and you encounter it. Never came trouble to my house in the likeness of your Grace, for trouble being gone, comfort should remain; but when you depart from me, sorrow abides and happiness takes his leave. You embrace your charge too willingly. I think this is your daughter. Her mother hath many times told me so. Were you in doubt, sir, that you asked her? Signior Benedick, no; for then you were a child. You have it full, Benedick: we may guess by this what you are, being a man. Truly, the lady fathers herself. Be happy, lady, for you are like an honourable father. If Signior Leonato be her father, she would not have his head on her shoulders for all Messina, as like him as she is. I wonder that you will still be talking, Signior Benedick: nobody marks you. What! my dear Lady Disdain, are you yet living? Is it possible Disdain should die while she hath such meet food to feed it as Signior Benedick? Courtesy itself must convert to disdain, if you come in her presence. Then is courtesy a turncoat. But it is certain I am loved of all ladies, only you excepted; and I would I could find in my heart that I had not a hard heart; for, truly, I love none. A dear happiness to women: they would else have been troubled with a pernicious suitor. I thank God and my cold blood, I am of your humour for that: I had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man swear he loves me. God keep your ladyship still in that mind; so some gentleman or other shall scape a predestinate scratched face. Scratching could not make it worse, an 'twere such a face as yours were. Well, you are a rare parrot-teacher. A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours. I would my horse had the speed of your tongue, and so good a continuer. But keep your way, i' God's name; I have done. You always end with a jade's trick: I know you of old. This is the sum of all, Leonato: Signior Claudio, and Signior Benedick, my dear friend Leonato hath invited you all. I tell him we shall stay here at the least a month, and he heartily prays some occasion may detain us longer: I dare swear he is no hypocrite, but prays from his heart. If you swear, my lord, you shall not be forsworn. Let me bid you welcome, my lord: being reconciled to the prince your brother, I owe you all duty. I thank you: I am not of many words, but I thank you. Please it your Grace lead on? Your hand, Leonato; we will go together. Benedick, didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato? I noted her not; but I looked on her. Is she not a modest young lady? Do you question me, as an honest man should do, for my simple true judgment; or would you have me speak after my custom, as being a professed tyrant to their sex? No; I pray thee speak in sober judgment. Why, i' faith, methinks she's too low for a high praise, too brown for a fair praise, and too little for a great praise: only this commendation I can afford her, that were she other than she is, she were unhandsome, and being no other but as she is, I do not like her. Thou thinkest I am in sport: I pray thee tell me truly how thou likest her. Would you buy her, that you inquire after her? Can the world buy such a jewel? Yea, and a case to put it into. But speak you this with a sad brow, or do you play the flouting Jack, to tell us Cupid is a good hare-finder, and Vulcan a rare carpenter? Come, in what key shall a man take you, to go in the song? In mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever I looked on. I can see yet without spectacles and I see no such matter: there's her cousin an she were not possessed with a fury, exceeds her as much in beauty as the first of May doth the last of December. But I hope you have no intent to turn husband, have you? I would scarce trust myself, though I had sworn to the contrary, if Hero would be my wife. Is't come to this, i' faith? Hath not the world one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion? Shall I never see a bachelor of three-score again? Go to, i' faith; an thou wilt needs thrust thy neck into a yoke, wear the print of it, and sigh away Sundays. Look! Don Pedro is returned to seek you. What secret hath held you here, that you followed not to Leonato's? I would your Grace would constrain me to tell. I charge thee on thy allegiance. You hear, Count Claudio: I can be secret as a dumb man; I would have you think so; but on my allegiance, mark you this, on my allegiance: he is in love. With who? now that is your Grace's part. Mark how short his answer is: with Hero, Leonato's short daughter. If this were so, so were it uttered. Like the old tale, my lord: 'it is not so, nor 'twas not so; but, indeed, God forbid it should be so.' If my passion change not shortly, God forbid it should be otherwise. Amen, if you love her; for the lady is very well worthy. You speak this to fetch me in, my lord. By my troth, I speak my thought. And in faith, my lord, I spoke mine. And by my two faiths and troths, my lord, I spoke mine. That I love her, I feel. That she is worthy, I know. That I neither feel how she should be loved nor know how she should be worthy, is the opinion that fire cannot melt out of me: I will die in it at the stake. Thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite of beauty. And never could maintain his part but in the force of his will. That a woman conceived me, I thank her; that she brought me up, I likewise give her most humble thanks: but that I will have a recheat winded in my forehead, or hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick, all women shall pardon me. Because I will not do them the wrong to mistrust any, I will do myself the right to trust none; and the fine is,â€”for the which I may go the finer,â€”I will live a bachelor. I shall see thee, ere I die, look pale with love. With anger, with sickness, or with hunger, my lord; not with love: prove that ever I lose more blood with love than I will get again with drinking, pick out mine eyes with a ballad-maker's pen, and hang me up at the door of a brothel-house for the sign of blind Cupid. Well, if ever thou dost fall from this faith, thou wilt prove a notable argument. If I do, hang me in a bottle like a cat and shoot at me; and he that hits me, let him be clapped on the shoulder, and called Adam. Well, as time shall try: 'In time the savage bull doth bear the yoke.' The savage bull may; but if ever the sensible Benedick bear it, pluck off the bull's horns and set them in my forehead; and let me be vilely painted, and in such great letters as they write, 'Here is good horse to hire,' let them signify under my sign 'Here you may see Benedick the married man.' If this should ever happen, thou wouldst be horn-mad. Nay, if Cupid have not spent all his quiver in Venice, thou wilt quake for this shortly. I look for an earthquake too then. Well, you will temporize with the hours. In the meantime, good Signior Benedick, repair to Leonato's: commend me to him and tell him I will not fail him at supper; for indeed he hath made great preparation. I have almost matter enough in me for such an embassage; and so I commit youâ€” To the tuition of God: from my house, if I had it,â€” The sixth of July: your loving friend, Benedick. Nay, mock not, mock not. The body of your discourse is sometime guarded with fragments, and the guards are but slightly basted on neither: ere you flout old ends any further, examine your conscience: and so I leave you. My liege, your highness now may do me good. My love is thine to teach: teach it but how, And thou shalt see how apt it is to learn Any hard lesson that may do thee good. Hath Leonato any son, my lord? No child but Hero; she's his only heir. Dost thou affect her, Claudio? O! my lord, When you went onward on this ended action, I looked upon her with a soldier's eye, That lik'd, but had a rougher task in hand Than to drive liking to the name of love; But now I am return'd, and that war-thoughts Have left their places vacant, in their rooms Come thronging soft and delicate desires, All prompting me how fair young Hero is, Saying, I lik'd her ere I went to wars. Thou wilt be like a lover presently, And tire the hearer with a book of words. If thou dost love fair Hero, cherish it, And I will break with her, and with her father, And thou shalt have her. Was't not to this end That thou began'st to twist so fine a story? How sweetly do you minister to love, That know love's grief by his complexion! But lest my liking might too sudden seem, I would have salv'd it with a longer treatise. What need the bridge much broader than the flood? The fairest grant is the necessity. Look, what will serve is fit: 'tis once, thou lov'st, And I will fit thee with the remedy. I know we shall have revelling to-night: I will assume thy part in some disguise, And tell fair Hero I am Claudio; And in her bosom I'll unclasp my heart, And take her hearing prisoner with the force And strong encounter of my amorous tale: Then, after to her father will I break; And the conclusion is, she shall be thine. In practice let us put it presently. How now, brother! Where is my cousin, your son? Hath he provided this music? He is very busy about it. But, brother, I can tell you strange news that you yet dreaint not of. Are they good? As the event stamps them: but they have a good cover; they show well outward. The prince and Count Claudio, walking in a thick-pleached alley in my orchard, were thus much overheard by a man of mine: the prince discovered to Claudio that he loved my niece your daughter, and meant to acknowledge it this night in a dance; and, if he found her accordant, he meant to take the present time by the top and instantly break with you of it. Hath the fellow any wit that told you this? A good sharp fellow: I will send for him; and question him yourself. No, no; we will hold it as a dream till it appear itself: but I will acquaint my daughter withal, that she may be the better prepared for an answer, if peradventure this be true. Go you, and tell her of it. Cousins, you know what you have to do. O! I cry you mercy, friend; go you with me, and I will use your skill. Good cousin, have a care this busy time. What the good-year, my lord! why are you thus out of measure sad? There is no measure in the occasion that breeds; therefore the sadness is without limit. You should hear reason. And when I have heard it, what blessing brings it? It not a present remedy, at least a patient sufferance. I wonder that thou, being,â€”as thou say'st thou art,â€”born under Saturn, goest about to apply a moral medicine to a mortifying mischief. I cannot hide what I am: I must be sad when I have cause, and smile at no man's jests; eat when I have stomach, and wait for no man's leisure; sleep when I am drowsy, and tend on no man's business; laugh when I am merry, and claw no man in his humour. Yea; but you must not make the full show of this till you may do it without controlment. You have of late stood out against your brother, and he hath ta'en you newly into his grace; where it is impossible you should take true root but by the fair weather that you make yourself: it is needful that you frame the season for your own harvest. I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in his grace; and it better fits my blood to be disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob love from any: in this, though I cannot be said to be a flattering honest man, it must not be denied but I am a plain-dealing villain. I am trusted with a muzzle and enfranchised with a clog; therefore I have decreed not to sing in my cage. If I had my mouth, I would bite; if I had my liberty, I would do my liking: in the meantime, let me be that I am, and seek not to alter me. Can you make no use of your discontent? I make all use of it, for I use it only. Who comes here? What news, Borachio? I came yonder from a great supper: the prince, your brother, is royally entertained by Leonato; and I can give you intelligence of an intended marriage. Will it serve for any model to build mischief on? What is he for a fool that betroths himself to unquietness? Marry, it is your brother's right hand. Who? the most exquisite Claudio? Even he. A proper squire! And who, and who? which way looks he? Marry, on Hero, the daughter and heir of Leonato. A very forward March-chick! How came you to this? Being entertained for a perfumer, as I was smoking a musty room, comes me the prince and Claudio, hand in hand, in sad conference: I whipt me behind the arras, and there heard it agreed upon that the prince should woo Hero for himself, and having obtained her, give her to Count Claudio. Come, come; let us thither: this may prove food to my displeasure. That young start-up hath all the glory of my overthrow: if I can cross him any way, I bless myself every way. You are both sure, and will assist me? To the death, my lord. To the death, my lord. Let us to the great supper: their cheer is the greater that I am subdued. Would the cook were of my mind! Shall we go prove what's to be done? We'll wait upon your lordship. Was not Count John here at supper? I saw him not. How tartly that gentleman looks! I never can see him but I am heart-burned an hour after. He is of a very melancholy disposition. He were an excellent man that were made just in the mid-way between him and Benedick: the one is too like an image, and says nothing; and the other too like my lady's eldest son, evermore tattling. Then half Signior Benedick's tongue in Count John's mouth, and half Count John's melancholy in Signior Benedick's face,â€” With a good leg and a good foot, uncle, and money enough in his purse, such a man would win any woman in the world, if a' could get her good will. By my troth, niece, thou wilt never get thee a husband, if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue. In faith, she's too curst. Too curst is more than curst: I shall lessen God's sending that way; for it is said, 'God sends a curst cow short horns;' but to a cow too curst he sends none. So, by being too curst, God will send you no horns? Just, if he send me no husband; for the which blessing I am at him upon my knees every morning and evening. Lord! I could not endure a husband with a beard on his face: I had rather lie in the woollen. You may light on a husband that hath no beard. What should I do with him? dress him in my apparel and make him my waiting-gentlewoman? He that hath a beard is more than a youth, and he that hath no beard is less than a man; and he that is more than a youth is not for me; and he that is less than a man, I am not for him: therefore I will even take sixpence in earnest of the bear-ward, and lead his apes into hell. Well then, go you into hell? No; but to the gate; and there will the devil meet me, like an old cuckold, with horns on his head, and say, 'Get you to heaven, Beatrice, get you to heaven; here's no place for you maids:' so deliver I up my apes, and away to Saint Peter for the heavens; he shows me where the bachelors sit, and there live we as merry as the day is long. Well, niece, I trust you will be ruled by your father. Yes, faith; it is my cousin's duty to make curtsy, and say, 'Father, as it please you:'â€”but yet for all that, cousin, let him be a handsome fellow, or else make another curtsy, and say, 'Father, as it please me.' Well, niece, I hope to see you one day fitted with a husband. Not till God make men of some other metal than earth. Would it not grieve a woman to be over-mastered with a piece of valiant dust? to make an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl? No, uncle, I'll none: Adam's sons are my brethren; and truly, I hold it a sin to match in my kindred. Daughter, remember what I told you: if the prince do solicit you in that kind, you know your answer. The fault will be in the music, cousin, if you be not wooed in good time: if the prince be too important, tell him there is measure in everything, and so dance out the answer. For, hear me, Hero: wooing, wedding, and repenting, is as a Scotch jig, a measure, and a cinque-pace: the first suit is hot and hasty, like a Scotch jig, and full as fantastical; the wedding, mannerly-modest, as a measure, full of state and ancientry; and then comes Repentance, and, with his bad legs, falls into the cinque-pace faster and faster, till he sink into his grave. Cousin, you apprehend passing shrewdly. I have a good eye, uncle: I can see a church by daylight. The revellers are entering, brother: make good room. Lady, will you walk about with your friend? So you walk softly and look sweetly and say nothing, I am yours for the walk; and especially when I walk away. With me in your company? I may say so, when I please. And when please you to say so? When I like your favour; for God defend the lute should be like the case! My visor is Philemon's roof; within the house is Jove. Why, then, your visor should be thatch'd. Speak low, if you speak love. Well, I would you did like me. So would not I, for your own sake; for I have many ill qualities. Which is one? I say my prayers aloud. I love you the better; the hearers may cry Amen. God match me with a good dancer! Amen. And God keep him out of my sight when the dance is done! Answer, clerk. No more words: the clerk is answered. I know you well enough: you are Signior Antonio. At a word, I am not. I know you by the waggling of your head. To tell you true, I counterfeit him. You could never do him so ill-well, unless you were the very man. Here's his dry hand up and down: you are he, you are he. At a word, I am not. Come, come; do you think I do not know you by your excellent wit? Can virtue hide itself? Go to, mum, you are he: graces will appear, and there's an end. Will you not tell me who told you so? No, you shall pardon me. Nor will you not tell me who you are? Not now. That I was disdainful, and that I had my good wit out of the 'Hundred Merry Tales.' Well, this was Signior Benedick that said so. What's he? I am sure you know him well enough. Not I, believe me. Did he never make you laugh? I pray you, what is he? Why, he is the prince's jester: a very dull fool; only his gift is in devising impossible slanders: none but libertines delight in him; and the commendation is not in his wit, but in his villany; for he both pleases men and angers them, and then they laugh at him and beat him. I am sure he is in the fleet: I would he had boarded me! When I know the gentleman, I'll tell him what you say. Do, do: he'll but break a comparison or two on me; which, peradventure not marked or not laughed at, strikes him into melancholy; and then there's a partridge wing saved, for the fool will eat no supper that night. We must follow the leaders. In every good thing. Nay, if they lead to any ill, I will leave them at the next turning. Sure my brother is amorous on Hero, and hath withdrawn her father to break with him about it. The ladies follow her and but one visor remains. And that is Claudio: I know him by his bearing. Are you not Signior Benedick? You know me well; I am he. Signior, you are very near my brother in his love: he is enamoured on Hero; I pray you, dissuade him from her; she is no equal for his birth: you may do the part of an honest man in it. How know you he loves her? I heard him swear his affection. So did I too; and he swore he would marry her to-night. Come, let us to the banquet. Thus answer I in name of Benedick, But hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio. 'Tis certain so; the prince woos for himself. Friendship is constant in all other things Save in the office and affairs of love: Therefore all hearts in love use their own tongues; Let every eye negotiate for itself And trust no agent; for beauty is a witch Against whose charms faith melteth into blood. This is an accident of hourly proof, Which I mistrusted not. Farewell, therefore, Hero! Count Claudio? Yea, the same. Come, will you go with me? Whither? Even to the next willow, about your own business, count. What fashion will you wear the garland of? About your neck, like a usurer's chain? or under your arm, like a lieutenant's scarf? You must wear it one way, for the prince hath got your Hero. I wish him joy of her. Why, that's spoken like an honest drovier: so they sell bullocks. But did you think the prince would have served you thus? I pray you, leave me. Ho! now you strike like the blind man: 'twas the boy that stole your meat, and you'll beat the post. If it will not be, I'll leave you. Alas! poor hurt fowl. Now will he creep into sedges. But, that my lady Beatrice should know me, and not know me! The prince's fool! Ha! it may be I go under that title because I am merry. Yea, but so I am apt to do myself wrong; I am not so reputed: it is the base though bitter disposition of Beatrice that puts the world into her person, and so gives me out. Well, I'll be revenged as I may. Now, signior, where's the count? Did you see him? Troth, my lord, I have played the part of Lady Fame. I found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a warren. I told him, and I think I told him true, that your Grace had got the good will of this young lady; and I offered him my company to a willow tree, either to make him a garland, as being forsaken, or to bind him up a rod, as being worthy to be whipped. To be whipped! What's his fault? The flat transgression of a school-boy, who, being overjoy'd with finding a bird's nest, shows it his companion, and he steals it. Wilt thou make a trust a transgression? The transgression is in the stealer. Yet it had not been amiss the rod had been made, and the garland too; for the garland he might have worn himself, and the rod he might have bestowed on you, who, as I take it, have stolen his bird's nest. I will but teach them to sing, and restore them to the owner. If their singing answer your saying, by my faith, you say honestly. The Lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you: the gentleman that danced with her told her she is much wronged by you. O! she misused me past the endurance of a block: an oak but with one green leaf on it, would have answered her: my very visor began to assume life and scold with her. She told me, not thinking I had been myself, that I was the prince's jester; that I was duller than a great thaw; huddling jest upon jest with such impossible conveyance upon me, that I stood like a man at a mark, with a whole army shooting at me. She speaks poniards, and every word stabs: if her breath were as terrible as her terminations, there were no living near her; she would infect to the north star. I would not marry her, though she were endowed with all that Adam had left him before he transgressed: she would have made Hercules have turned spit, yea, and have cleft his club to make the fire too. Come, talk not of her; you shall find her the infernal Ate in good apparel. I would to God some scholar would conjure her, for certainly, while she is here, a man may live as quiet in hell as in a sanctuary; and people sin upon purpose because they would go thither; so, indeed, all disquiet, horror and perturbation follow her. Look! here she comes. Will your Grace command me any service to the world's end? I will go on the slightest errand now to the Antipodes that you can devise to send me on; I will fetch you a toothpicker now from the furthest inch of Asia; bring you the length of Prester John's foot; fetch you a hair off the Great Cham's beard; do you any embassage to the Pigmies, rather than hold three words' conference with this harpy. You have no employment for me? None, but to desire your good company. O God, sir, here's a dish I love not: I cannot endure my Lady Tongue. Come, lady, come; you have lost the heart of Signior Benedick. Indeed, my lord, he lent it me awhile; and I gave him use for it, a double heart for a single one: marry, once before he won it of me with false dice, therefore your Grace may well say I have lost it. You have put him down, lady, you have put him down. So I would not he should do me, my lord, lest I should prove the mother of fools. I have brought Count Claudio, whom you sent me to seek. Why, how now, count! wherefore are you sad? Not sad, my lord. How then? Sick? Neither, my lord. The count is neither sad, nor sick, nor merry, nor well; but civil count, civil as an orange, and something of that jealous complexion. I' faith, lady, I think your blazon to be true; though, I'll be sworn, if he be so, his conceit is false. Here, Claudio, I have wooed in thy name, and fair Hero is won; I have broke with her father, and, his good will obtained; name the day of marriage, and God give thee joy! Count, take of me my daughter, and with her my fortunes: his Grace hath made the match, and all grace say Amen to it! Speak, count, 'tis your cue. Silence is the perfectest herald of joy: I were but little happy, if I could say how much. Lady, as you are mine, I am yours: I give away myself for you and dote upon the exchange. Speak, cousin; or, if you cannot, stop his mouth with a kiss, and let not him speak neither. In faith, lady, you have a merry heart. Yea, my lord; I thank it, poor fool, it keeps on the windy side of care. My cousin tells him in his ear that he is in her heart. And so she doth, cousin. Good Lord, for alliance! Thus goes every one to the world but I, and I am sunburnt. I may sit in a corner and cry heigh-ho for a husband! Lady Beatrice, I will get you one. I would rather have one of your father's getting. Hath your Grace ne'er a brother like you? Your father got excellent husbands, if a maid could come by them. Will you have me, lady? No, my lord, unless I might have another for working days: your Grace is too costly to wear every day. But, I beseech your Grace, pardon me; I was born to speak all mirth and no matter. Your silence most offends me, and to be merry best becomes you; for, out of question, you were born in a merry hour. No, sure, my lord, my mother cried; but then there was a star danced, and under that was I born. Cousins, God give you joy! Niece, will you look to those things I told you of? I cry you mercy, uncle. By your Grace's pardon. By my troth, a pleasant-spirited lady. There's little of the melancholy element in her, my lord: she is never sad but when she sleeps; and not ever sad then, for I have heard my daughter say, she hath often dreamed of unhappiness and waked herself with laughing. She cannot endure to hear tell of a husband. O! by no means: she mocks all her wooers out of suit. She were an excellent wife for Benedick. O Lord! my lord, if they were but a week married, they would talk themselves mad. Count Claudio, when mean you to go to church? To-morrow, my lord. Time goes on crutches till love have all his rites. Not till Monday, my dear son, which is hence a just seven-night; and a time too brief too, to have all things answer my mind. Come, you shake the head at so long a breathing; but, I warrant thee, Claudio, the time shall not go dully by us. I will in the interim undertake one of Hercules' labours, which is, to bring Signior Benedick and the Lady Beatrice into a mountain of affection the one with the other. I would fain have it a match; and I doubt not but to fashion it, if you three will but minister such assistance as I shall give you direction. My lord, I am for you, though it cost me ten nights' watchings. And I, my lord. And you too, gentle Hero? I will do any modest office, my lord, to help my cousin to a good husband. And Benedick is not the unhopefullest husband that I know. Thus far can I praise him; he is of a noble strain, of approved valour, and confirmed honesty. I will teach you how to humour your cousin, that she shall fall in love with Benedick; and I, with your two helps, will so practise on Benedick that, in despite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach, he shall fall in love with Beatrice. If we can do this, Cupid is no longer an archer: his glory shall be ours, for we are the only love-gods. Go in with me, and I will tell you my drift. It is so; the Count Claudio shall marry the daughter of Leonato. Yea, my lord; but I can cross it. Any bar, any cross, any impediment will be medicinable to me: I am sick in displeasure to him, and whatsoever comes athwart his affection ranges evenly with mine. How canst thou cross this marriage? Not honestly, my lord; but so covertly that no dishonesty shall appear in me. Show me briefly how. I think I told your lordship, a year since, how much I am in the favour of Margaret, the waiting-gentlewoman to Hero. I remember. I can, at any unseasonable instant of the night, appoint her to look out at her lady's chamber-window. What life is in that, to be the death of this marriage? The poison of that lies in you to temper. Go you to the prince your brother; spare not to tell him, that he hath wronged his honour in marrying the renowned Claudio,â€”whose estimation do you mightily hold up,â€”to a contaminated stale, such a one as Hero. What proof shall I make of that? Proof enough to misuse the prince, to vex Claudio, to undo Hero, and kill Leonato. Look you for any other issue? Only to despite them, I will endeavour any thing. Go, then; find me a meet hour to draw Don Pedro and the Count Claudio alone: tell them that you know that Hero loves me; intend a kind of zeal both to the prince and Claudio, asâ€”in love of your brother's honour, who hath made this match, and his friend's reputation, who is thus like to be cozened with the semblance of a maid,â€”that you have discovered thus. They will scarcely believe this without trial: offer them instances, which shall bear no less likelihood than to see me at her chamber-window, hear me call Margaret Hero; hear Margaret term me Claudio; and bring them to see this the very night before the intended wedding: for in the meantime I will so fashion the matter that Hero shall be absent; and there shall appear such seeming truth of Hero's disloyalty, that jealousy shall be called assurance, and all the preparation overthrown. Grow this to what adverse issue it can, I will put it in practice. Be cunning in the working this, and thy fee is a thousand ducats. Be you constant in the accusation, and my cunning shall not shame me. I will presently go learn their day of marriage. Boy! Signior? In my chamber-window lies a book; bring it hither to me in the orchard. I am here already, sir. I know that; but I would have thee hence, and here again. I do much wonder that one man, seeing how much another man is a fool when he dedicates his behaviours to love, will, after he hath laughed at such shallow follies in others, become the argument of his own scorn by falling in love: and such a man is Claudio. I have known, when there was no music with him but the drum and the fife; and now had he rather hear the tabor and the pipe: I have known, when he would have walked ten mile afoot to see a good armour; and now will he lie ten nights awake, carving the fashion of a new doublet. He was wont to speak plain and to the purpose, like an honest man and a soldier; and now is he turned orthographer; his words are a very fantastical banquet, just so many strange dishes. May I be so converted, and see with these eyes? I cannot tell; I think not: I will not be sworn but love may transform me to an oyster; but I'll take my oath on it, till he have made an oyster of me, he shall never make me such a fool. One woman is fair, yet I am well; another is wise, yet I am well; another virtuous, yet I am well; but till all graces be in one woman, one woman shall not come in my grace. Rich she shall be, that's certain; wise, or I'll none; virtuous, or I'll never cheapen her; fair, or I'll never look on her; mild, or come not near me; noble, or not I for an angel; of good discourse, an excellent musician, and her hair shall be of what colour it please God. Ha! the prince and Monsieur Love! I will hide me in the arbour. Come, shall we hear this music? Yea, my good lord. How still the evening is, As hush'd on purpose to grace harmony! See you where Benedick hath hid himself? O! very well, my lord: the music ended, We'll fit the kid-fox with a penny-worth. Come, Balthazar, we'll hear that song again. O! good my lord, tax not so bad a voice To slander music any more than once. It is the witness still of excellency, To put a strange face on his own perfection. I pray thee, sing, and let me woo no more. Because you talk of wooing, I will sing; Since many a wooer doth commence his suit To her he thinks not worthy; yet he woos; Yet will he swear he loves. Nay, pray thee, come; Or if thou wilt hold longer argument, Do it in notes. Note this before my notes; There's not a note of mine that's worth the noting. Why these are very crotchets that he speaks; Notes, notes, forsooth, and nothing! Now, divine air! now is his soul ravished! Is it not strange that sheeps' guts should hale souls out of men's bodies? Well, a horn for my money, when all's done. Sigh no more, ladies, sigh no more, Men were deceivers ever; One foot in sea, and one on shore, To one thing constant never. Then sigh not so, But let them go, And be you blithe and bonny, Converting all your sounds of woe Into Hey nonny, nonny. Sing no more ditties, sing no mo Of dumps so dull and heavy; The fraud of men was ever so, Since summer first was leavy. Then sigh not so, But let them go, And be you blithe and bonny, Converting all your sounds of woe Into Hey nonny, nonny. By my troth, a good song. And an ill singer, my lord. Ha, no, no, faith; thou singest well enough for a shift. An he had been a dog that should have howled thus, they would have hanged him; and I pray God his bad voice bode no mischief. I had as lief have heard the night-raven, come what plague could have come after it. Yea, marry; dost thou hear, Balthazar? I pray thee, get us some excellent music, for to-morrow night we would have it at the Lady Hero's chamber-window. The best I can, my lord. Do so: farewell. Come hither, Leonato: what was it you told me of to-day, that your niece Beatrice was in love with Signior Benedick? O! ay:â€” Stalk on, stalk on; the fowl sits. I did never think that lady would have loved any man. No, nor I neither; but most wonderful that she should so dote on Signior Benedick, whom she hath in all outward behaviours seemed ever to abhor. Is't possible? Sits the wind in that corner? By my troth, my lord, I cannot tell what to think of it but that she loves him with an enraged affection: it is past the infinite of thought. May be she doth but counterfeit. Faith, like enough. O God! counterfeit! There was never counterfeit of passion came so near the life of passion as she discovers it. Why, what effects of passion shows she? Bait the hook well: this fish will bite. What effects, my lord? She will sit you; You heard my daughter tell you how. She did, indeed. How, how, I pray you? You amaze me: I would have thought her spirit had been invincible against all assaults of affection. I would have sworn it had, my lord; especially against Benedick. I should think this a gull, but that the white-bearded fellow speaks it: knavery cannot, sure, hide itself in such reverence. He hath ta'en the infection: hold it up. Hath she made her affection known to Benedick? No; and swears she never will: that's her torment. 'Tis true, indeed; so your daughter says: 'Shall I,' says she, 'that have so oft encountered him with scorn, write to him that I love him?' This says she now when she is beginning to write to him; for she'll be up twenty times a night, and there will she sit in her smock till she have writ a sheet of paper: my daughter tells us all. Now you talk of a sheet of paper, I remember a pretty jest your daughter told us of. O! when she had writ it, and was reading it over, she found Benedick and Beatrice between the sheet? That. O! she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence; railed at herself, that she should be so immodest to write to one that she knew would flout her: 'I measure him,' says she, 'by my own spirit; for I should flout him, if he writ to me; yea, though I love him, I should.' Then down upon her knees she falls, weeps, sobs, beats her heart, tears her hair, prays, curses; 'O sweet Benedick! God give me patience!' She doth indeed; my daughter says so; and the ecstasy hath so much overborne her, that my daughter is sometimes afeard she will do a desperate outrage to herself. It is very true. It were good that Benedick knew of it by some other, if she will not discover it. To what end? he would but make a sport of it and torment the poor lady worse. An he should, it were an alms to hang him. She's an excellent sweet lady, and, out of all suspicion, she is virtuous. And she is exceeding wise. In everything but in loving Benedick. O! my lord, wisdom and blood combating in so tender a body, we have ten proofs to one that blood hath the victory. I am sorry for her, as I have just cause, being her uncle and her guardian. I would she had bestowed this dotage on me; I would have daffed all other respects and made her half myself. I pray you, tell Benedick of it, and hear what a' will say. Were it good, think you? Hero thinks surely she will die; for she says she will die if he love her not, and she will die ere she make her love known, and she will die if he woo her, rather than she will bate one breath of her accustomed crossness. She doth well: if she should make tender of her love, 'tis very possible he'll scorn it; for the man,â€”as you know all,â€”hath a contemptible spirit. he is a very proper man. He hath indeed a good outward happiness. 'Fore God, and in my mind, very wise. He doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit. And I take him to be valiant. As Hector, I assure you: and in the managing of quarrels you may say he is wise; for either he avoids them with great discretion, or undertakes them with a most Christian-like fear. If he do fear God, a' must necessarily keep peace: if he break the peace, he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and trembling. And so will he do; for the man doth fear God, howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests he will make. Well, I am sorry for your niece. Shall we go seek Benedick, and tell him of her love? Never tell him, my lord: let her wear it out with good counsel. Nay, that's impossible: she may wear her heart out first. Well, we will hear further of it by your daughter: let it cool the while. I love Benedick well, and I could wish he would modestly examine himself, to see how much he is unworthy to have so good a lady. My lord, will you walk? dinner is ready. If he do not dote on her upon this, I will never trust my expectation. Let there be the same net spread for her; and that must your daughter and her gentlewoman carry. The sport will be, when they hold one an opinion of another's dotage, and no such matter: that's the scene that I would see, which will be merely a dumbshow. Let us send her to call him in to dinner. This can be no trick: the conference was sadly borne. They have the truth of this from Hero. They seem to pity the lady: it seems, her affections have their full bent. Love me! why, it must be requited. I hear how I am censured: they say I will bear myself proudly, if I perceive the love come from her; they say too that she will rather die than give any sign of affection. I did never think to marry: I must not seem proud: happy are they that hear their detractions, and can put them to mending. They say the lady is fair: 'tis a truth, I can bear them witness; and virtuous: 'tis so, I cannot reprove it; and wise, but for loving me: by my troth, it is no addition to her wit, nor no great argument of her folly, for I will be horribly in love with her. I may chance have some odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me, because I have railed so long against marriage; but doth not the appetite alter? A man loves the meat in his youth that he cannot endure in his age. Shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of the brain awe a man from the career of his humour? No; the world must be peopled. When I said I would die a bachelor, I did not think I should live till I were married. Here comes Beatrice. By this day! she's a fair lady: I do spy some marks of love in her. Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner. Fair Beatrice, I thank you for your pains. I took no more pains for those thanks than you take pains to thank me: if it had been painful, I would not have come. You take pleasure then in the message? Yea, just so much as you may take upon a knife's point, and choke a daw withal. You have no stomach, signior: fare you well. Ha! 'Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner,' there's a double meaning in that. 'I took no more pains for those thanks than you took pains to thank me,' that's as much as to say, Any pains that I take for you is as easy as thanks. If I do not take pity of her, I am a villain; if I do not love her, I am a Jew. I will go get her picture. Good Margaret, run thee to the parlour; There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice Proposing with the prince and Claudio: Whisper her ear, and tell her, I and Ursula Walk in the orchard, and our whole discourse Is all of her; say that thou overheard'st us, And bid her steal into the pleached bower, Where honey-suckles, ripen'd by the sun, Forbid the sun to enter; like favourites, Made proud by princes, that advance their pride Against that power that bred it. There will she hide her, To listen our propose. This is thy office; Bear thee well in it and leave us alone. I'll make her come, I warrant you, presently. Now, Ursula, when Beatrice doth come, As we do trace this alley up and down, Our talk must only be of Benedick: When I do name him, let it be thy part To praise him more than ever man did merit. My talk to thee must be how Benedick Is sick in love with Beatrice: of this matter Is little Cupid's crafty arrow made, That only wounds by hearsay. Now begin; For look where Beatrice, like a lapwing, runs Close by the ground, to hear our conference. The pleasant'st angling is to see the fish Cut with her golden oars the silver stream, And greedily devour the treacherous bait: So angle we for Beatrice; who even now Is couched in the woodbine coverture. Fear you not my part of the dialogue. Then go we near her, that her ear lose nothing Of the false sweet bait that we lay for it. No, truly, Ursula, she is too disdainful; I know her spirits are as coy and wild As haggerds of the rock. But are you sure That Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely? So says the prince, and my new-trothed lord. And did they bid you tell her of it, madam? They did entreat me to acquaint her of it; But I persuaded them, if they lov'd Benedick, To wish him wrestle with affection, And never to let Beatrice know of it. Why did you so? Doth not the gentleman Deserve as full as fortunate a bed As ever Beatrice shall couch upon? O god of love! I know he doth deserve As much as may be yielded to a man; But nature never fram'd a woman's heart Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice; Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes, Misprising what they look on, and her wit Values itself so highly, that to her All matter else seems weak. She cannot love, Nor take no shape nor project of affection, She is so self-endear'd. Sure, I think so; And therefore certainly it were not good She knew his love, lest she make sport at it. Why, you speak truth. I never yet saw man, How wise, how noble, young, how rarely featur'd, But she would spell him backward: if fair-fac'd, She would swear the gentleman should be her sister; If black, why, Nature, drawing of an antick, Made a foul blot; if tall, a lance ill-headed; If low, an agate very vilely cut; If speaking, why, a vane blown with all winds; If silent, why, a block moved with none. So turns she every man the wrong side out, And never gives to truth and virtue that Which simpleness and merit purchaseth. Sure, sure, such carping is not commendable. No; not to be so odd and from all fashions As Beatrice is, cannot be commendable. But who dare tell her so? If I should speak, She would mock me into air: O! she would laugh me Out of myself, press me to death with wit. Therefore let Benedick, like cover'd fire, Consume away in sighs, waste inwardly: It were a better death than die with mocks, Which is as bad as die with tickling. Yet tell her of it: hear what she will say. No; rather I will go to Benedick, And counsel him to fight against his passion. And, truly, I'll devise some honest slanders To stain my cousin with. One doth not know How much an ill word may empoison liking. O! do not do your cousin such a wrong. She cannot be so much without true judgment,â€” Having so swift and excellent a wit As she is priz'd to have,â€”as to refuse So rare a gentleman as Signior Benedick. He is the only man of Italy, Always excepted my dear Claudio. I pray you, be not angry with me, madam, Speaking my fancy: Signior Benedick, For shape, for bearing, argument and valour, Goes foremost in report through Italy. Indeed, he hath an excellent good name. His excellence did earn it, ere he had it. When are you married, madam? Why, every day, to-morrow. Come, go in: I'll show thee some attires, and have thy counsel Which is the best to furnish me to-morrow. She's lim'd, I warrant you: we have caught her, madam. If it prove so, then loving goes by haps: Some Cupid kills with arrows, some with traps. What fire is in mine ears? Can this be true? Stand I condemn'd for pride and scorn so much? Contempt, farewell! and maiden pride, adieu! No glory lives behind the back of such. And, Benedick, love on; I will requite thee, Taming my wild heart to thy loving hand: If thou dost love, my kindness shall incite thee To bind our loves up in a holy band; For others say thou dost deserve, and I Believe it better than reportingly. I do but stay till your marriage be consummate, and then go I toward Arragon. I'll bring you thither, my lord, if you'll vouchsafe me. Nay, that would be as great a soil in the new gloss of your marriage, as to show a child his new coat and forbid him to wear it. I will only be bold with Benedick for his company; for, from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot, he is all mirth: he hath twice or thrice cut Cupid's bow-string, and the little hangman dare not shoot at him. He hath a heart as sound as a bell, and his tongue is the clapper; for what his heart thinks his tongue speaks. Gallants, I am not as I have been. So say I: methinks you are sadder. I hope he be in love. Hang him, truant! there's no true drop of blood in him, to be truly touched with love. If he be sad, he wants money. I have the tooth-ache. Draw it. Hang it. You must hang it first, and draw it afterwards. What! sigh for the tooth-ache? Where is but a humour or a worm? Well, every one can master a grief but he that has it. Yet say I, he is in love. There is no appearance of fancy in him, unless it be a fancy that he hath to strange disguises; as, to be a Dutchman to-day, a Frenchman to-morrow, or in the shape of two countries at once, as a German from the waist downward, all slops, and a Spaniard from the hip upward, no doublet. Unless he have a fancy to this foolery, as it appears he hath, he is no fool for fancy, as you would have it appear he is. If he be not in love with some woman, there is no believing old signs: a' brushes his hat a mornings; what should that bode? Hath any man seen him at the barber's? No, but the barber's man hath been seen with him; and the old ornament of his cheek hath already stuffed tennis-balls. Indeed he looks younger than he did, by the loss of a beard. Nay, a' rubs himself with civet: can you smell him out by that? That's as much as to say the sweet youth's in love. The greatest note of it is his melancholy. And when was he wont to wash his face? Yea, or to paint himself? for the which, I hear what they say of him. Nay, but his jesting spirit; which is now crept into a lute-string, and new-governed by stops. Indeed, that tells a heavy tale for him. Conclude, conclude he is in love. Nay, but I know who loves him. That would I know too: I warrant, one that knows him not. Yes, and his ill conditions; and in despite of all, dies for him. She shall be buried with her face upwards. Yet is this no charm for the tooth-ache. Old signior, walk aside with me: I have studied eight or nine wise words to speak to you, which these hobby-horses must not hear. For my life, to break with him about Beatrice. 'Tis even so. Hero and Margaret have by this played their parts with Beatrice, and then the two bears will not bite one another when they meet. My lord and brother, God save you! Good den, brother. If your leisure served, I would speak with you. In private? If it please you; yet Count Claudio may hear, for what I would speak of concerns him. What's the matter? Means your lordship to be married to-morrow? You know he does. I know not that, when he knows what I know. If there be any impediment, I pray you discover it. You may think I love you not: let that appear hereafter, and aim better at me by that I now will manifest. For my brother, I think he holds you well, and in dearness of heart hath holp to effect your ensuing marriage; surely suit ill-spent, and labour ill bestowed! Why, what's the matter? I came hither to tell you; and circumstances shortened,â€”for she hath been too long a talking of,â€”the lady is disloyal. Who, Hero? Even she: Leonato's Hero, your Hero, every man's Hero. Disloyal? The word's too good to paint out her wickedness; I could say, she were worse: think you of a worse title, and I will fit her to it. Wonder not till further warrant: go but with me to-night, you shall see her chamber-window entered, even the night before her wedding-day: if you love her then, to-morrow wed her; but it would better fit your honour to change your mind. May this be so? I will not think it. If you dare not trust that you see, confess not that you know. If you will follow me, I will show you enough; and when you have seen more and heard more, proceed accordingly. If I see any thing to-night why I should not marry her to-morrow, in the congregation, where I should wed, there will I shame her. And, as I wooed for thee to obtain her, I will join with thee to disgrace her. I will disparage her no further till you are my witnesses: bear it coldly but till midnight, and let the issue show itself. O day untowardly turned! O mischief strangely thwarting! O plague right well prevented! So will you say when you have seen the sequel. Are you good men and true? Yea, or else it were pity but they should suffer salvation, body and soul. Nay, that were a punishment too good for them, if they should have any allegiance in them, being chosen for the prince's watch. Well, give them their charge, neighbour Dogberry. First, who think you the most desartless man to be constable? Hugh Oatcake, sir, or George Seacoal; for they can write and read. Come hither, neighbour Seacoal. God hath blessed you with a good name: to be a well-favoured man is the gift of fortune; but to write and read comes by nature. Both which, Master constable,â€” You have: I knew it would be your answer. Well, for your favour, sir, why, give God thanks, and make no boast of it; and for your writing and reading, let that appear when there is no need of such vanity. You are thought here to be the most senseless and fit man for the constable of the watch; therefore bear you the lanthorn. This is your charge: you shall comprehend all vagrom men; you are to bid any man stand, in the prince's name. How, if a' will not stand? Why, then, take no note of him, but let him go; and presently call the rest of the watch together, and thank God you are rid of a knave. If he will not stand when he is bidden, he is none of the prince's subjects. True, and they are to meddle with none but the prince's subjects. You shall also make no noise in the streets: for, for the watch to babble and to talk is most tolerable and not to be endured. We will rather sleep than talk: we know what belongs to a watch. Why, you speak like an ancient and most quiet watchman, for I cannot see how sleeping should offend; only have a care that your bills be not stolen. Well, you are to call at all the alehouses, and bid those that are drunk get them to bed. How if they will not? Why then, let them alone till they are sober: if they make you not then the better answer, you may say they are not the men you took them for. Well, sir. If you meet a thief, you may suspect him, by virtue of your office, to be no true man; and, for such kind of men, the less you meddle or make with them, why, the more is for your honesty. If we know him to be a thief, shall we not lay hands on him? Truly, by your office, you may; but I think they that touch pitch will be defiled. The most peaceable way for you, if you do take a thief, is, to let him show himself what he is and steal out of your company. You have been always called a merciful man, partner. Truly, I would not hang a dog by my will, much more a man who hath any honesty in him. If you hear a child cry in the night, you must call to the nurse and bid her still it. How if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us? Why, then, depart in peace, and let the child wake her with crying; for the ewe that will not hear her lamb when it baes, will never answer a calf when he bleats. 'Tis very true. This is the end of the charge. You constable, are to present the prince's own person: if you meet the prince in the night, you may stay him. Nay, by 'r lady, that I think, a' cannot. Five shillings to one on't, with any man that knows the statues, he may stay him: marry, not without the prince be willing; for, indeed, the watch ought to offend no man, and it is an offence to stay a man against his will. By 'r lady, I think it be so. Ha, ah, ha! Well, masters, good night: an there be any matter of weight chances, call up me: keep your fellows' counsels and your own, and good night. Come, neighbour. Well, masters, we hear our charge: let us go sit here upon the church-bench till two, and then all go to bed. One word more, honest neighbours. I pray you, watch about Signior Leonato's door; for the wedding being there to-morrow, there is a great coil to-night. Adieu; be vigitant, I beseech you. What, Conrade! Peace! stir not. Conrade, I say! Here, man, I am at thy elbow. Mass, and my elbow itched; I thought there would a scab follow. I will owe thee an answer for that; and now forward with thy tale. Stand thee close then under this penthouse, for it drizzles rain, and I will, like a true drunkard, utter all to thee. Some treason, masters; yet stand close. Therefore know, I have earned of Don John a thousand ducats. Is it possible that any villany should be so dear? Thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible any villany should be so rich; for when rich villains have need of poor ones, poor ones may make what price they will. I wonder at it. That shows thou art unconfirmed. Thou knowest that the fashion of a doublet, or a hat, or a cloak, is nothing to a man. Yes, it is apparel. I mean, the fashion. Yes, the fashion is the fashion. Tush! I may as well say the fool's the fool. But seest thou not what a deformed thief this fashion is? I know that Deformed; a' has been a vile thief this seven years; a' goes up and down like a gentleman: I remember his name. Didst thou not hear somebody? No: 'twas the vane on the house. Seest thou not, I say, what a deformed thief this fashion is? how giddily he turns about all the hot bloods between fourteen and five-and-thirty? sometime fashioning them like Pharaoh's soldiers in the reechy painting; sometime like god Bel's priests in the old church-window; sometime like the shaven Hercules in the smirched worm-eaten tapestry, where his cod-piece seems as massy as his club? All this I see, and I see that the fashion wears out more apparel than the man. But art not thou thyself giddy with the fashion too, that thou hast shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion? Not so, neither; but know, that I have to-night wooed Margaret, the Lady Hero's gentlewoman, by the name of Hero: she leans me out at her mistress' chamber-window, bids me a thousand times good night,â€”I tell this tale vilely:â€”I should first tell thee how the prince, Claudio, and my master, planted and placed and possessed by my master Don John, saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter. And thought they Margaret was Hero? Two of them did, the prince and Claudio; but the devil my master, knew she was Margaret; and partly by his oaths, which first possessed them, partly by the dark night, which did deceive them, but chiefly by my villany, which did confirm any slander that Don John had made, away went Claudio enraged; swore he would meet her, as he was appointed, next morning at the temple, and there, before the whole congregation, shame her with what he saw o'er night, and send her home again without a husband. We charge you in the prince's name, stand! Call up the right Master constable. We have here recovered the most dangerous piece of lechery that ever was known in the commonwealth. And one Deformed is one of them: I know him, a' wears a lock. Masters, masters! You'll be made bring Deformed forth, I warrant you. Masters,â€” Never speak: we charge you let us obey you to go with us. We are like to prove a goodly commodity, being taken up of these men's bills. A commodity in question, I warrant you. Come, we'll obey you. Good Ursula, wake my cousin Beatrice, and desire her to rise. I will, lady. And bid her come hither. Well. Troth, I think your other rabato were better. No, pray thee, good Meg, I'll wear this. By my troth's not so good; and I warrant your cousin will say so. My cousin's a fool, and thou art another: I'll wear none but this. I like the new tire within excellently, if the hair were a thought browner; and your gown's a most rare fashion, i' faith. I saw the Duchess of Milan's gown that they praise so. O! that exceeds, they say. By my troth's but a night-gown in respect of yours: cloth o' gold, and cuts, and laced with silver, set with pearls, down sleeves, side sleeves, and skirts round, underborne with a bluish tinsel; but for a fine, quaint, graceful, and excellent fashion, yours is worth ten on't. God give me joy to wear it! for my heart is exceeding heavy. 'Twill be heavier soon by the weight of a man. Fie upon thee! art not ashamed? Of what, lady? of speaking honourably? is not marriage honourable in a beggar? Is not your lord honourable without marriage? I think you would have me say, 'saving your reverence, a husband:' an bad thinking do not wrest true speaking, I'll offend nobody. Is there any harm in 'the heavier for a husband?' None, I think, an it be the right husband and the right wife; otherwise 'tis light, and not heavy: ask my Lady Beatrice else; here she comes. Good morrow, coz. Good morrow, sweet Hero. Why, how now! do you speak in the sick tune? I am out of all other tune, methinks. Clap's into 'Light o' love;' that goes without a burden: do you sing it, and I'll dance it. Ye light o' love with your heels! then, if your husband have stables enough, you'll see he shall lack no barns. O illegitimate construction! I scorn that with my heels. 'Tis almost five o'clock, cousin; 'tis time you were ready. By my troth, I am exceeding ill. Heigh-ho! For a hawk, a horse, or a husband? For the letter that begins them all, H. Well, an you be not turned Turk, there's no more sailing by the star. What means the fool, trow? Nothing I; but God send every one their heart's desire! These gloves the count sent me; they are an excellent perfume. I am stuffed, cousin, I cannot smell. A maid, and stuffed! there's goodly catching of cold. O, God help me! God help me! how long have you professed apprehension? Ever since you left it. Doth not my wit become me rarely! It is not seen enough, you should wear it in your cap. By my troth, I am sick. Get you some of this distilled Carduus Benedictus, and lay it to your heart: it is the only thing for a qualm. There thou prick'st her with a thistle. Benedictus! why Benedictus? you have some moral in this Benedictus. Moral! no, by my troth, I have no moral meaning; I meant, plain holy-thistle. You may think, perchance, that I think you are in love: nay, by'r lady, I am not such a fool to think what I list; nor I list not to think what I can; nor, indeed, I cannot think, if I would think my heart out of thinking, that you are in love, or that you will be in love, or that you can be in love. Yet Benedick was such another, and now is he become a man: he swore he would never marry; and yet now, in despite of his heart, he eats his meat without grudging: and how you may be converted, I know not; but methinks you look with your eyes as other women do. What pace is this that thy tongue keeps? Not a false gallop. Madam, withdraw: the prince, the count, Signior Benedick, Don John, and all the gallants of the town, are come to fetch you to church. Help to dress me, good coz, good Meg, good Ursula. What would you with me, honest neighbour? Marry, sir, I would have some confidence with you, that decerns you nearly. Brief, I pray you; for you see it is a busy time with me. Marry, this it is, sir. Yes, in truth it is, sir. What is it, my good friends? Goodman Verges, sir, speaks a little off the matter: an old man, sir, and his wits are not so blunt, as, God help, I would desire they were; but, in faith, honest as the skin between his brows. Yes, I thank God, I am as honest as any man living, that is an old man and no honester than I. Comparisons are odorous: palabras, neighbour Verges. Neighbours, you are tedious. It pleases your worship to say so, but we are the poor duke's officers; but truly, for mine own part, if I were as tedious as a king, I could find in my heart to bestow it all of your worship. All thy tediousness on me! ha? Yea, an't were a thousand pound more than 'tis; for I hear as good exclamation on your worship, as of any man in the city, and though I be but a poor man, I am glad to hear it. And so am I. I would fain know what you have to say. Marry, sir, our watch to-night, excepting your worship's presence, ha' ta'en a couple of as arrant knaves as any in Messina. A good old man, sir; he will be talking; as they say, 'when the age is in, the wit is out.' God help us! it is a world to see! Well said, i' faith, neighbour Verges: well, God's a good man; an two men ride of a horse, one must ride behind. An honest soul, i' faith, sir; by my troth he is, as ever broke bread: but God is to be worshipped: all men are not alike; alas! good neighbour. Indeed, neighbour, he comes too short of you. Gifts that God gives. I must leave you. One word, sir: our watch, sir, hath indeed comprehended two aspicious persons, and we would have them this morning examined before your worship. Take their examination yourself, and bring it me: I am now in great haste, as may appear unto you. It shall be suffigance. Drink some wine ere you go: fare you well. My lord, they stay for you to give your daughter to her husband. I'll wait upon them: I am ready. Go, good partner, go, get you to Francis Seacoal; bid him bring his pen and inkhorn to the gaol: we are now to examination these men. And we must do it wisely. We will spare for no wit, I warrant you; here's that shall drive some of them to a non-come: only get the learned writer to set down our excommunication, and meet me at the gaol. Come, Friar Francis, be brief: only to the plain form of marriage, and you shall recount their particular duties afterwards. You come hither, my lord, to marry this lady? No. To be married to her, friar; you come to marry her. Lady, you come hither to be married to this count? I do. If either of you know any inward impediment, why you should not be conjoined, I charge you, on your souls, to utter it. Know you any, Hero? None, my lord. Know you any, count? I dare make his answer; none. O! what men dare do! what men may do! what men daily do, not knowing what they do! How now! Interjections? Why then, some be of laughing, as ah! ha! he! Stand thee by, friar. Father, by your leave: Will you with free and unconstrained soul Give me this maid, your daughter? As freely, son, as God did give her me. And what have I to give you back whose worth May counterpoise this rich and precious gift? Nothing, unless you render her again. Sweet prince, you learn me noble thankfulness. There, Leonato, take her back again: Give not this rotten orange to your friend; She's but the sign and semblance of her honour. Behold! how like a maid she blushes here. O! what authority and show of truth Can cunning sin cover itself withal. Comes not that blood as modest evidence To witness simple virtue? Would you not swear, All you that see her, that she were a maid, By these exterior shows? But she is none: She knows the heat of a luxurious bed; Her blush is guiltiness, not modesty. What do you mean, my lord? Not to be married, Not to knit my soul to an approved wanton. Dear my lord, if you, in your own proof, Have vanquish'd the resistance of her youth, And made defeat of her virginity,â€” I know what you would say: if I have known her, You'll say she did embrace me as a husband, And so extenuate the 'forehand sin: No, Leonato, I never tempted her with word too large; But, as a brother to his sister, show'd Bashful sincerity and comely love. And seem'd I ever otherwise to you? Out on thee! Seeming! I will write against it: You seem to me as Dian in her orb, As chaste as is the bud ere it be blown; But you are more intemperate in your blood Than Venus, or those pamper'd animals That rage in savage sensuality. Is my lord well, that he doth speak so wide? Sweet prince, why speak not you? What should I speak? I stand dishonour'd, that have gone about To link my dear friend to a common stale. Are these things spoken, or do I but dream? Sir, they are spoken, and these things are true. This looks not like a nuptial. True! O God! Leonato, stand I here? Is this the prince? Is this the prince's brother? Is this face Hero's? Are our eyes our own? All this is so; but what of this, my lord? Let me but move one question to your daughter; And by that fatherly and kindly power That you have in her, bid her answer truly. I charge thee do so, as thou art my child. O, God defend me! how am I beset! What kind of catechizing call you this? To make you answer truly to your name. Is it not Hero? Who can blot that name With any just reproach? Marry, that can Hero: Hero itself can blot out Hero's virtue. What man was he talk'd with you yesternight Out at your window, betwixt twelve and one? Now, if you are a maid, answer to this. I talk'd with no man at that hour, my lord. Why, then are you no maiden. Leonato, I am sorry you must hear: upon mine honour, Myself, my brother, and this grieved count, Did see her, hear her, at that hour last night, Talk with a ruffian at her chamber-window; Who hath indeed, most like a liberal villain, Confess'd the vile encounters they have had A thousand times in secret. Fie, fie! they are not to be nam'd, my lord, Not to be spoke of; There is not chastity enough in language Without offence to utter them. Thus, pretty lady, I am sorry for thy much misgovernment. O Hero! what a Hero hadst thou been, If half thy outward graces had been plac'd About thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart! But fare thee well, most foul, most fair! farewell, Thou pure impiety, and impious purity! For thee I'll lock up all the gates of love, And on my eyelids shall conjecture hang, To turn all beauty into thoughts of harm, And never shall it more be gracious. Hath no man's dagger here a point for me? Why, how now, cousin! wherefore sink you down? Come, let us go. These things, come thus to light, Smother her spirits up. How doth the lady? Dead, I think! help, uncle! Hero! why, Hero! Uncle! Signior Benedick! Friar! O Fate! take not away thy heavy hand: Death is the fairest cover for her shame That may be wish'd for. How now, cousin Hero! Have comfort, lady. Dost thou look up? Yea; wherefore should she not? Wherefore! Why, doth not every earthly thing Cry shame upon her? Could she here deny The story that is printed in her blood? Do not live, Hero; do not ope thine eyes; For, did I think thou wouldst not quickly die, Thought I thy spirits were stronger than thy shames, Myself would, on the rearward of reproaches, Strike at thy life. Griev'd I, I had but one? Chid I for that at frugal nature's frame? O! one too much by thee. Why had I one? Why ever wast thou lovely in mine eyes? Why had I not with charitable hand Took up a beggar's issue at my gates, Who smirched thus, and mir'd with infamy, I might have said, 'No part of it is mine; This shame derives itself from unknown loins?' But mine, and mine I lov'd, and mine I prais'd, And mine that I was proud on, mine so much That I myself was to myself not mine, Valuing of her; why, sheâ€”O! she is fallen Into a pit of ink, that the wide sea Hath drops too few to wash her clean again, And salt too little which may season give To her foul-tainted flesh. Sir, sir, be patient. For my part, I am so attir'd in wonder, I know not what to say. O! on my soul, my cousin is belied! Lady, were you her bedfellow last night? No, truly, not; although, until last night, I have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow. Confirm'd, confirm'd! O! that is stronger made, Which was before barr'd up with ribs of iron. Would the two princes lie? and Claudio lie, Who lov'd her so, that, speaking of her foulness, Wash'd it with tears? Hence from her! let her die. Hear me a little; For I have only been silent so long, And given way unto this course of fortune, By noting of the lady: I have mark'd A thousand blushing apparitions To start into her face; a thousand innocent shames In angel whiteness bear away those blushes; And in her eye there hath appear'd a fire, To burn the errors that these princess hold Against her maiden truth. Call me a fool; Trust not my reading nor my observations, Which with experimental seal doth warrant The tenour of my book; trust not my age, My reverence, calling, nor divinity, If this sweet lady lie not guiltless here Under some biting error. Friar, it cannot be. Thou seest that all the grace that she hath left Is, that she will not add to her damnation A sin of perjury: she not denies it. Why seek'st thou then to cover with excuse That which appears in proper nakedness? Lady, what man is he you are accus'd of? They know that do accuse me, I know none; If I know more of any man alive Than that which maiden modesty doth warrant, Let all my sins lack mercy! O, my father! Prove you that any man with me convers'd At hours unmeet, or that I yesternight Maintain'd the change of words with any creature, Refuse me, hate me, torture me to death. There is some strange misprision in the princes. Two of them have the very bent of honour; And if their wisdoms be misled in this, The practice of it lives in John the bastard, Whose spirits toil in frame of villanies. I know not. If they speak but truth of her, These hands shall tear her; if they wrong her honour, The proudest of them shall well hear of it. Time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine. Nor age so eat up my invention, Nor fortune made such havoc of my means, Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends, But they shall find, awak'd in such a kind, Both strength of limb and policy of mind, Ability in means and choice of friends, To quit me of them throughly. Pause awhile, And let my counsel sway you in this case. Your daughter here the princes left for dead; Let her awhile be secretly kept in, And publish it that she is dead indeed: Maintain a mourning ostentation; And on your family's old monument Hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites That appertain unto a burial. What shall become of this? What will this do? Marry, this well carried shall on her behalf Change slander to remorse; that is some good: But not for that dream I on this strange course, But on this travail look for greater birth. She dying, as it must be so maintain'd, Upon the instant that she was accus'd, Shall be lamented, pitied and excus'd Of every hearer; for it so falls out That what we have we prize not to the worth Whiles we enjoy it, but being lack'd and lost, Why, then we rack the value, then we find The virtue that possession would not show us Whiles it was ours. So will it fare with Claudio: When he shall hear she died upon his words, The idea of her life shall sweetly creep Into his study of imagination, And every lovely organ of her life Shall come apparell'd in more precious habit, More moving-delicate, and full of life Into the eye and prospect of his soul, Than when she liv'd indeed: then shall he mourn,â€” If ever love had interest in his liver,â€” And wish he had not so accused her, No, though he thought his accusation true. Let this be so, and doubt not but success Will fashion the event in better shape Than I can lay it down in likelihood. But if all aim but this be levell'd false, The supposition of the lady's death Will quench the wonder of her infamy: And if it sort not well, you may conceal her,â€” As best befits her wounded reputation,â€” In some reclusive and religious life, Out of all eyes, tongues, minds, and injuries. Signior Leonato, let the friar advise you: And though you know my inwardness and love Is very much unto the prince and Claudio, Yet, by mine honour, I will deal in this As secretly and justly as your soul Should with your body. Being that I flow in grief, The smallest twine may lead me. 'Tis well consented: presently away; For to strange sores strangely they strain the cure. Come, lady, die to live: this wedding day Perhaps is but prolong'd: have patience and endure. Lady Beatrice, have you wept all this while? Yea, and I will weep a while longer. I will not desire that. You have no reason; I do it freely. Surely I do believe your fair cousin is wronged. Ah! how much might the man deserve of me that would right her. Is there any way to show such friendship? A very even way, but no such friend. May a man do it? It is a man's office, but not yours. I do love nothing in the world so well as you: is not that strange? As strange as the thing I know not. It were as possible for me to say I loved nothing so well as your, but believe me not, and yet I lie not; I confess nothing, not I deny nothing. I am sorry for my cousin. By my sword, Beatrice, thou lovest me. Do not swear by it, and eat it. I will swear by it that you love me; and I will make him eat it that says I love not you. Will you not eat your word? With no sauce that can be devised to it. I protest I love thee. Why then, God forgive me! What offence, sweet Beatrice? You have stayed me in a happy hour: I was about to protest I loved you. And do it with all thy heart. I love you with so much of my heart that none is left to protest. Come, bid me do anything for thee. Kill Claudio. Ha! not for the wide world. You kill me to deny it. Farewell. Tarry, sweet Beatrice. I am gone, though I am here: there is no love in you: nay, I pray you, let me go. Beatrice,â€” In faith, I will go. We'll be friends first. You dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemy. Is Claudio thine enemy? Is he not approved in the height a villain, that hath slandered, scorned, dishonoured my kinswoman? O! that I were a man. What! bear her in hand until they come to take hands, and then, with public accusation, uncovered slander, unmitigated rancour,â€”O God, that I were a man! I would eat his heart in the market-place. Hear me, Beatrice,â€” Talk with a man out at a window! a proper saying! Nay, but Beatrice,â€” Sweet Hero! she is wronged, she is slandered, she is undone. Beatâ€” Princes and counties! Surely, a princely testimony, a goodly Count Comfect; a sweet gallant, surely! O! that I were a man for his sake, or that I had any friend would be a man for my sake! But manhood is melted into curtsies, valour into compliment, and men are only turned into tongue, and trim ones too: he is now as valiant as Hercules, that only tells a lie and swears it. I cannot be a man with wishing, therefore I will die a woman with grieving. Tarry, good Beatrice. By this hand, I love thee. Use it for my love some other way than swearing by it. Think you in your soul the Count Claudio hath wronged Hero? Yea, as sure as I have a thought or a soul. Enough! I am engaged, I will challenge him. I will kiss your hand, and so leave you. By this hand, Claudio shall render me a dear account. As you hear of me, so think of me. Go, comfort your cousin: I must say she is dead; and so, farewell. Is our whole dissembly appeared? O! a stool and a cushion for the sexton. Which be the malefactors? Marry, that am I and my partner. Nay, that's certain: we have the exhibition to examine. But which are the offenders that are to be examined? let them come before Master constable. Yea, marry, let them come before me. What is your name, friend? Borachio. Pray write down Borachio. Yours, sirrah? I am a gentleman, sir, and my name is Conrade. Write down Master gentleman Conrade. Masters, do you serve God? Yea, sir, we hope. Yea, sir, we hope. Write down that they hope they serve God: and write God first; for God defend but God should go before such villains! Masters, it is proved already that you are little better than false knaves, and it will go near to be thought so shortly. How answer you for yourselves? Marry, sir, we say we are none. A marvellous witty fellow, I assure you; but I will go about with him. Come you hither, sirrah; a word in your ear: sir, I say to you, it is thought you are false knaves. Sir, I say to you we are none. Well, stand aside. 'Fore God, they are both in a tale. Have you writ down, that they are none? Master constable, you go not the way to examine: you must call forth the watch that are their accusers. Yea, marry, that's the eftest way. Let the watch come forth. Masters, I charge you, in the prince's name, accuse these men. This man said, sir, that Don John, the prince's brother, was a villain. Write down Prince John a villain. Why, this is flat perjury, to call a prince's brother villain. Master constable,â€” Pray thee, fellow, peace: I do not like thy look, I promise thee. What heard you him say else? Marry, that he had received a thousand ducats of Don John for accusing the Lady Hero wrongfully. Flat burglary as ever was committed. Yea, by the mass, that it is. What else, fellow? And that Count Claudio did mean, upon his words, to disgrace Hero before the whole assembly, and not marry her. O villain! thou wilt be condemned into everlasting redemption for this. What else? This is all. And this is more, masters, than you can deny. Prince John is this morning secretly stolen away: Hero was in this manner accused, in this very manner refused, and, upon the grief of this, suddenly died. Master constable, let these men be bound, and brought to Leonato's: I will go before and show him their examination. Come, let them be opinioned. Let them be in the handsâ€” Off, coxcomb! God's my life! where's the sexton? let him write down the prince's officer coxcomb. Come, bind them. Thou naughty varlet! Away! you are an ass; you are an ass. Dost thou not suspect my place? Dost thou not suspect my years? O that he were here to write me down an ass! but, masters, remember that I am an ass; though it be not written down, yet forget not that I am an ass. No, thou villain, thou art full of piety, as shall be proved upon thee by good witness. I am a wise fellow; and, which is more, an officer; and, which is more, a householder; and, which is more, as pretty a piece of flesh as any in Messina; and one that knows the law, go to; and a rich fellow enough, go to; and a fellow that hath had losses; and one that hath two gowns, and everything handsome about him. Bring him away. O that I had been writ down an ass! If you go on thus, you will kill yourself; And 'tis not wisdom thus to second grief Against yourself. I pray thee, cease thy counsel, Which falls into mine ears as profitless As water in a sieve: give not me counsel; Nor let no comforter delight mine ear But such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine: Bring me a father that so lov'd his child, Whose joy of her is overwhelm'd like mine, And bid him speak of patience; Measure his woe the length and breadth of mine, And let it answer every strain for strain, As thus for thus and such a grief for such, In every lineament, branch, shape, and form: If such a one will smile, and stroke his beard; Bid sorrow wag, cry 'hem' when he should groan, Patch grief with proverbs; make misfortune drunk With candle-wasters; bring him yet to me, And I of him will gather patience. But there is no such man; for, brother, men Can counsel and speak comfort to that grief Which they themselves not feel; but, tasting it, Their counsel turns to passion, which before Would give preceptial medicine to rage, Fetter strong madness in a silken thread, Charm ache with air and agony with words. No, no; 'tis all men's office to speak patience To those that wring under the load of sorrow, But no man's virtue nor sufficiency To be so moral when he shall endure The like himself. Therefore give me no counsel: My griefs cry louder than advertisement. Therein do men from children nothing differ. I pray thee, peace! I will be flesh and blood; For there was never yet philosopher That could endure the toothache patiently, However they have writ the style of gods And made a push at chance and sufferance. Yet bend not all the harm upon yourself; Make those that do offend you suffer too. There thou speak'st reason: nay, I will do so. My soul doth tell me Hero is belied; And that shall Claudio know; so shall the prince, And all of them that thus dishonour her. Here come the prince and Claudio hastily. Good den, good den. Good day to both of you. Hear you, my lords,â€” We have some haste, Leonato. Some haste, my lord! well, fare you well, my lord: Are you so hasty now?â€”well, all is one. Nay, do not quarrel with us, good old man. If he could right himself with quarrelling, Some of us would lie low. Who wrongs him? Marry, thou dost wrong me; thou dissembler, thou. Nay, never lay thy hand upon thy sword; I fear thee not. Marry, beshrew my hand, If it should give your age such cause of fear. In faith, my hand meant nothing to my sword. Tush, tush, man! never fleer and jest at me: I speak not like a dotard nor a fool, As, under privilege of age, to brag What I have done being young, or what would do, Were I not old. Know, Claudio, to thy head, Thou hast so wrong'd mine innocent child and me That I am forc'd to lay my reverence by, And, with grey hairs and bruise of many days, Do challenge thee to trial of a man. I say thou hast belied mine innocent child: Thy slander hath gone through and through her heart, And she lies buried with her ancestors; O! in a tomb where never scandal slept, Save this of hers, fram'd by thy villany! My villany? Thine, Claudio; thine, I say. You say not right, old man. My lord, my lord, I'll prove it on his body, if he dare, Despite his nice fence and his active practice, His May of youth and bloom of lustihood. Away! I will not have to do with you. Canst thou so daff me? Thou hast kill'd my child; If thou kill'st me, boy, thou shalt kill a man. He shall kill two of us, and men indeed: But that's no matter; let him kill one first: Win me and wear me; let him answer me. Come, follow me, boy; come, sir boy, come, follow me. Sir boy, I'll whip you from your foining fence; Nay, as I am a gentleman, I will. Brother,â€” Content yourself. God knows I lov'd my niece; And she is dead, slander'd to death by villains, That dare as well answer a man indeed As I dare take a serpent by the tongue. Boys, apes, braggarts, Jacks, milksops! Brother Antony,â€” Hold you content. What, man! I know them, yea, And what they weigh, even to the utmost scruple, Scrambling, out-facing, fashion-monging boys, That lie and cog and flout, deprave and slander, Go antickly, show outward hideousness, And speak off half a dozen dangerous words, How they might hurt their enemies, if they durst; And this is all! But, brother Antony,â€” Come, 'tis no matter: Do not you meddle, let me deal in this. Gentlemen both, we will not wake your patience. My heart is sorry for your daughter's death; But, on my honour, she was charg'd with nothing But what was true and very full of proof. My lord, my lordâ€” I will not hear you. No? Come, brother, away. I will be heard.â€” And shall, or some of us will smart for it. See, see; here comes the man we went to seek. Now, signior, what news? Good day, my lord. Welcome, signior: you are almost come to part almost a fray. We had like to have had our two noses snapped off with two old men without teeth. Leonato and his brother. What thinkest thou? Had we fought, I doubt we should have been too young for them. In a false quarrel there is no true valour. I came to seek you both. We have been up and down to seek thee; for we are high-proof melancholy, and would fain have it beaten away. Wilt thou use thy wit? It is in my scabbard; shall I draw it? Dost thou wear thy wit by thy side? Never any did so, though very many have been beside their wit. I will bid thee draw, as we do the minstrels; draw, to pleasure us. As I am an honest man, he looks pale. Art thou sick, or angry? What, courage, man! What though care killed a cat, thou hast mettle enough in thee to kill care. Sir, I shall meet your wit in the career, an you charge it against me. I pray you choose another subject. Nay then, give him another staff: this last was broke cross. By this light, he changes more and more: I think he be angry indeed. If he be, he knows how to turn his girdle. Shall I speak a word in your ear? God bless me from a challenge! You are a villain; I jest not: I will make it good how you dare, with what you dare, and when you dare. Do me right, or I will protest your cowardice. You have killed a sweet lady, and her death shall fall heavy on you. Let me hear from you. Well I will meet you, so I may have good cheer. What, a feast, a feast? I' faith, I thank him; he hath bid me to a calf's-head and a capon, the which if I do not carve most curiously, say my knife's naught. Shall I not find a woodcock too? Sir, your wit ambles well; it goes easily. I'll tell thee how Beatrice praised thy wit the other day. I said, thou hadst a fine wit. 'True,' says she, 'a fine little one.' 'No,' said I, 'a great wit.' 'Right,' said she, 'a great gross one.' 'Nay,' said I, 'a good wit.' 'Just,' said she, 'it hurts nobody.' 'Nay,' said I, 'the gentleman is wise.' 'Certain,' said she, 'a wise gentleman.' 'Nay,' said I, 'he hath the tongues.' 'That I believe,' said she. 'for he swore a thing to me on Monday night, which he forswore on Tuesday morning: there's a double tongue; there's two tongues.' Thus did she, an hour together, trans-shape thy particular virtues; yet at last she concluded with a sigh, thou wast the properest man in Italy. For the which she wept heartily and said she cared not. Yea, that she did; but yet, for all that, an if she did not hate him deadly, she would love him dearly. The old man's daughter told us all. All, all; and moreover, God saw him when he was hid in the garden. But when shall we set the savage bull's horns on the sensible Benedick's head? Yea, and text underneath, 'Here dwells Benedick the married man!' Fare you well, boy: you know my mind. I will leave you now to your gossip-like humour: you break jests as braggarts do their blades, which, God be thanked, hurt not. My lord, for your many courtesies I thank you: I must discontinue your company. Your brother the bastard is fled from Messina: you have, among you, killed a sweet and innocent lady. For my Lord Lack-beard there, he and I shall meet; and till then, peace be with him. He is in earnest. In most profound earnest; and, I'll warrant you, for the love of Beatrice. And hath challenged thee? Most sincerely. What a pretty thing man is when he goes in his doublet and hose and leaves off his wit! He is then a giant to an ape; but then is an ape a doctor to such a man. But, soft you; let me be: pluck up, my heart, and be sad! Did he not say my brother was fled? Come, you, sir: if justice cannot tame you, she shall ne'er weigh more reasons in her balance. Nay, an you be a cursing hypocrite once, you must be looked to. How now! two of my brother's men bound! Borachio, one! Hearken after their offence, my lord. Officers, what offence have these men done? Marry, sir, they have committed false report; moreover, they have spoken untruths; secondarily, they are slanders; sixth and lastly, they have belied a lady; thirdly, they have verified unjust things; and to conclude, they are lying knaves. First, I ask thee what they have done; thirdly, I ask thee what's their offence; sixth and lastly, why they are committed; and, to conclude, what you lay to their charge? Rightly reasoned, and in his own division; and, by my troth, there's one meaning well suited. Who have you offended, masters, that you are thus bound to your answer? this learned constable is too cunning to be understood. What's your offence? Sweet prince, let me go no further to mine answer: do you hear me, and let this count kill me. I have deceived even your very eyes: what your wisdoms could not discover, these shallow fools have brought to light; who, in the night overheard me confessing to this man how Don John your brother incensed me to slander the Lady Hero; how you were brought into the orchard and saw me court Margaret in Hero's garments; how you disgraced her, when you should marry her. My villany they have upon record; which I had rather seal with my death than repeat over to my shame. The lady is dead upon mine and my master's false accusation; and, briefly, I desire nothing but the reward of a villain. Runs not this speech like iron through your blood? I have drunk poison whiles he utter'd it. But did my brother set thee on to this? Yea; and paid me richly for the practice of it. He is compos'd and fram'd of treachery: And fled he is upon this villany. Sweet Hero! now thy image doth appear In the rare semblance that I lov'd it first. Come, bring away the plaintiffs: by this time our sexton hath reformed Signior Leonato of the matter. And masters, do not forget to specify, when time and place shall serve, that I am an ass. Here, here comes Master Signior Leonato, and the sexton too. Which is the villain? Let me see his eyes, That, when I note another man like him, I may avoid him. Which of these is he? If you would know your wronger, look on me. Art thou the slave that with thy breath hast kill'd Mine innocent child? Yea, even I alone. No, not so, villain; thou beliest thyself: Here stand a pair of honourable men; A third is fled, that had a hand in it. I thank you, princes, for my daughter's death Record it with your high and worthy deeds. 'Twas bravely done, if you bethink you of it. I know not how to pray your patience; Yet I must speak. Choose your revenge yourself; Impose me to what penance your invention Can lay upon my sin: yet sinn'd I not But in mistaking. By my soul, nor I: And yet, to satisfy this good old man, I would bend under any heavy weight That he'll enjoin me to. I cannot bid you bid my daughter live; That were impossible: but, I pray you both, Possess the people in Messina here How innocent she died; and if your love Can labour aught in sad invention, Hang her an epitaph upon her tomb, And sing it to her bones: sing it to-night. To-morrow morning come you to my house, And since you could not be my son-in-law, Be yet my nephew. My brother hath a daughter, Almost the copy of my child that's dead, And she alone is heir to both of us: Give her the right you should have given her cousin, And so dies my revenge. O noble sir, Your over-kindness doth wring tears from me! I do embrace your offer; and dispose For henceforth of poor Claudio. To-morrow then I will expect your coming; To-night I take my leave. This naughty man Shall face to face be brought to Margaret, Who, I believe, was pack'd in all this wrong, Hir'd to it by your brother. No, by my soul she was not; Nor knew not what she did when she spoke to me; But always hath been just and virtuous In anything that I do know by her. Moreover, sir,â€”which, indeed, is not under white and black,â€”this plaintiff here, the offender, did call me ass: I beseech you, let it be remembered in his punishment. And also, the watch heard them talk of one Deformed: they say he wears a key in his ear and a lock hanging by it, and borrows money in God's name, the which he hath used so long and never paid, that now men grow hard-hearted, and will lend nothing for God's sake. Pray you, examine him upon that point. I thank thee for thy care and honest pains. Your worship speaks like a most thankful and reverend youth, and I praise God for you. There's for thy pains. God save the foundation! Go, I discharge thee of thy prisoner, and I thank thee. I leave an arrant knave with your worship; which I beseech your worship to corect yourself, for the example of others. God keep your worship! I wish your worship well; God restore you to health! I humbly give you leave to depart, and if a merry meeting may be wished, God prohibit it! Come, neighbour. Until to-morrow morning, lords, farewell. Farewell, my lords: we look for you to-morrow. We will not fail. To-night I'll mourn with Hero. Bring you these fellows on. We'll talk with Margaret, How her acquaintance grew with this lewd fellow. Pray thee, sweet Mistress Margaret, deserve well at my hands by helping me to the speech of Beatrice. Will you then write me a sonnet in praise of my beauty? In so high a style, Margaret, that no man living shall come over it; for, in most comely truth, thou deservest it. To have no man come over me! why, shall I always keep below stairs? Thy wit is as quick as the greyhound's mouth; it catches. And yours as blunt as the fencer's foils, which hit, but hurt not. A most manly wit, Margaret; it will not hurt a woman: and so, I pray thee, call Beatrice. I give thee the bucklers. Give us the swords, we have bucklers of our own. If you use them, Margaret, you must put in the pikes with a vice; and they are dangerous weapons for maids. Well, I will call Beatrice to you, who I think hath legs. And therefore will come. The god of love, That sits above, And knows me, and knows me, How pitiful I deserve,â€” I mean, in singing; but in loving, Leander the good swimmer, Troilus the first employer of pandars, and a whole book full of these quondam carpet-mongers, whose names yet run smoothly in the even road of a blank verse, why, they were never so truly turned over and over as my poor self, in love. Marry, I cannot show it in rime; I have tried: I can find out no rime to 'lady' but 'baby,' an innocent rime; for 'scorn,' 'horn,' a hard rime; for 'school,' 'fool,' a babbling rime; very ominous endings: no, I was not born under a riming planet, nor I cannot woo in festival terms. Sweet Beatrice, wouldst thou come when I called thee? Yea, signior; and depart when you bid me. O, stay but till then! 'Then' is spoken; fare you well now: and yet, ere I go, let me go with that I came for; which is, with knowing what hath passed between you and Claudio. Only foul words; and thereupon I will kiss thee. Foul words is but foul wind, and foul wind is but foul breath, and foul breath is noisome; therefore I will depart unkissed. Thou hast frighted the word out of his right sense, so forcible is thy wit. But I must tell thee plainly, Claudio undergoes my challenge, and either I must shortly hear from him, or I will subscribe him a coward. And, I pray thee now, tell me, for which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with me? For them all together; which maintained so politic a state of evil that they will not admit any good part to intermingle with them. But for which of my good parts did you first suffer love for me? 'Suffer love,' a good epithet! I do suffer love indeed, for I love thee against my will. In spite of your heart, I think. Alas, poor heart! If you spite it for my sake, I will spite it for yours; for I will never love that which my friend hates. Thou and I are too wise to woo peaceably. It appears not in this confession: there's not one wise man among twenty that will praise himself. An old, an old instance, Beatrice, that lived in the time of good neighbours. If a man do not erect in this age his own tomb ere he dies, he shall live no longer in monument than the bell rings and the widow weeps. And how long is that think you? Question: why, an hour in clamour and a quarter in rheum: therefore it is most expedient for the wise,â€”if Don Worm, his conscience, find no impediment to the contrary,â€”to be the trumpet of his own virtues, as I am to myself. So much for praising myself, who, I myself will bear witness, is praiseworthy. And now tell me, how doth your cousin? Very ill. And how do you? Very ill too. Serve God, love me, and mend. There will I leave you too, for here comes one in haste. Madam, you must come to your uncle. Yonder's old coil at home: it is proved, my Lady Hero hath been falsely accused, the prince and Claudio mightily abused; and Don John is the author of all, who is fled and gone. Will you come presently? Will you go hear this news, signior? I will live in thy heart, die in thy lap, and be buried in thy eyes; and moreover I will go with thee to thy uncle's. Is this the monument of Leonato? It is, my lord. Done to death by slanderous tongues Was the Hero that here lies: Death, in guerdon of her wrongs, Gives her fame which never dies. So the life that died with shame Lives in doath with glorious fame. Hang thou there upon the tomb, Praising her when I am dumb. Now, music, sound, and sing your solemn hymn. Pardon, goddess of the night, Those that slew thy virgin knight; For the which, with songs of woe, Round about her tomb they go. Midnight, assist our moan; Help us to sigh and groan, Heavily, heavily: Graves, yawn and yield your dead, Till death be uttered, Heavily, heavily. Now, unto thy bones good night! Yearly will I do this rite. Good morrow, masters: put your torches out. The wolves have prey'd; and look, the gentle day, Before the wheels of PhÅ“bus, round about Dapples the drowsy east with spots of grey. Thanks to you all, and leave us: fare you well Good morrow, masters: each his several way. Come, let us hence, and put on other weeds; And then to Leonato's we will go. And Hymen now with luckier issue speed's, Than this for whom we render'd up this woe! Did I not tell you she was innocent? So are the prince and Claudio, who accus'd her Upon the error that you heard debated: But Margaret was in some fault for this, Although against her will, as it appears In the true course of all the question. Well, I am glad that all things sort so well. And so am I, being else by faith enforc'd To call young Claudio to a reckoning for it. Well, daughter, and you gentlewomen all, Withdraw into a chamber by yourselves, And when I send for you, come hither mask'd: The prince and Claudio promis'd by this hour To visit me. You know your office, brother; You must be father to your brother's daughter, And give her to young Claudio. Which I will do with confirm'd countenance. Friar, I must entreat your pains, I think. To do what, signior? To bind me, or undo me; one of them. Signior Leonato, truth it is, good signior, Your niece regards me with an eye of favour. That eye my daughter lent her: 'tis most true. And I do with an eye of love requite her. The sight whereof I think, you had from me, From Claudio, and the prince. But what's your will? Your answer, sir, is enigmatical: But, for my will, my will is your good will May stand with ours, this day to be conjoin'd In the state of honourable marriage: In which, good friar, I shall desire your help. My heart is with your liking. And my help. Here come the prince and Claudio. Good morrow to this fair assembly. Good morrow, prince; good morrow, Claudio: We here attend you. Are you yet determin'd To-day to marry with my brother's daughter? I'll hold my mind, were she an Ethiop. Call her forth, brother: here's the friar ready. Good morrow, Benedick. Why, what's the matter, That you have such a February face, So full of frost, of storm and cloudiness? I think he thinks upon the savage bull. Tush! fear not, man, we'll tip thy horns with gold, And all Europa shall rejoice at thee, As once Europa did at lusty Jove, When he would play the noble beast in love. Bull Jove, sir, had an amiable low: And some such strange bull leap'd your father's cow, And got a calf in that same noble feat, Much like to you, for you have just his bleat. For this I owe you: here come other reckonings. Which is the lady I must seize upon? This same is she, and I do give you her. Why, then she's mine. Sweet, let me see your face. No, that you shall not, till you take her hand Before this friar, and swear to marry her. Give me your hand: before this holy friar, I am your husband, if you like of me. And when I liv'd, I was your other wife: And when you lov'd, you were my other husband. Another Hero! Nothing certainer: One Hero died defil'd, but I do live, And surely as I live, I am a maid. The former Hero! Hero that is dead! She died, my lord, but whiles her slander liv'd. All this amazement can I qualify: When after that the holy rites are ended, I'll tell you largely of fair Hero's death: Meantime, let wonder seem familiar, And to the chapel let us presently. Soft and fair, friar. Which is Beatrice? I answer to that name. What is your will? Do not you love me? Why, no; no more than reason. Why, then, your uncle and the prince and Claudio Have been deceived; for they swore you did. Do not you love me? Troth, no; no more than reason. Why, then, my cousin, Margaret, and Ursula, Are much deceiv'd; for they did swear you did. They swore that you were almost sick for me. They swore that you were well-nigh dead for me. 'Tis no such matter. Then, you do not love me? No, truly, but in friendly recompense. Come, cousin, I am sure you love the gentleman. And I'll be sworn upon 't that he loves her; For here's a paper written in his hand, A halting sonnet of his own pure brain, Fashion'd to Beatrice. And here's another, Writ in my cousin's hand, stolen from her pocket, Containing her affection unto Benedick. A miracle! here's our own hands against our hearts. Come, I will have thee; but, by this light, I take thee for pity. I would not deny you; but, by this good day, I yield upon great persuasion, and partly to save your life, for I was told you were in a consumption. Peace! I will stop your mouth. How dost thou, Benedick, the married man? I'll tell thee what, prince; a college of witcrackers cannot flout me out of my humour. Dost thou think I care for a satire or an epigram? No; if a man will be beaten with brains, a' shall wear nothing handsome about him. In brief, since I do purpose to marry, I will think nothing to any purpose that the world can say against it; and therefore never flout at me for what I have said against it, for man is a giddy thing, and this is my conclusion. For thy part, Claudio, I did think to have beaten thee; but, in that thou art like to be my kinsman, live unbruised, and love my cousin. I had well hoped thou wouldst have denied Beatrice, that I might have cudgelled thee out of thy single life, to make thee a double-dealer; which, out of question, thou wilt be, if my cousin do not look exceeding narrowly to thee. Come, come, we are friends. Let's have a dance ere we are married, that we may lighten our own hearts and our wives' heels. We'll have dancing afterward. First, of my word; therefore play, music! Prince, thou art sad; get thee a wife, get thee a wife: there is no staff more reverend than one tipped with horn. My lord, your brother John is ta'en in flight, And brought with armed men back to Messina. Think not on him till to-morrow: I'll devise thee brave punishments for him. Strike up, pipers!\n"

      "Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour Draws on apace: four happy days bring in Another moon; but O! methinks how slow This old moon wanes; she lingers my desires, Like to a step dame, or a dowager Long withering out a young man's revenue. Four days will quickly steep themselves in night; Four nights will quickly dream away the time; And then the moon, like to a silver bow New-bent in heaven, shall behold the night Of our solemnities. Go, Philostrate, Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments; Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth; Turn melancholy forth to funerals; The pale companion is not for our pomp. Hippolyta, I woo'd thee with my sword, And won thy love doing thee injuries; But I will wed thee in another key, With pomp, with triumph, and with revelling. Happy be Theseus, our renowned duke! Thanks, good Egeus: what's the news with thee? Full of vexation come I, with complaint Against my child, my daughter Hermia. Stand forth, Demetrius. My noble lord, This man hath my consent to marry her. Stand forth, Lysander: and, my gracious duke, This man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my child: Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rimes, And interchang'd love-tokens with my child; Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung, With feigning voice, verses of feigning love; And stol'n the impression of her fantasy With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gawds, conceits, Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats, messengers Of strong prevailment in unharden'd youth; With cunning hast thou filch'd my daughter's heart; Turn'd her obedience, which is due to me, To stubborn harshness. And, my gracious duke, Be it so she will not here before your Grace Consent to marry with Demetrius, I beg the ancient privilege of Athens, As she is mine, I may dispose of her; Which shall be either to this gentleman, Or to her death, according to our law Immediately provided in that case. What say you, Hermia? be advis'd, fair maid. To you, your father should be as a god; One that compos'd your beauties, yea, and one To whom you are but as a form in wax By him imprinted, and within his power To leave the figure or disfigure it. Demetrius is a worthy gentleman. So is Lysander. In himself he is; But, in this kind, wanting your father's voice, The other must be held the worthier. I would my father look'd but with my eyes. Rather your eyes must with his judgment look. I do entreat your Grace to pardon me. I know not by what power I am made bold, Nor how it may concern my modesty In such a presence here to plead my thoughts; But I beseech your Grace, that I may know The worst that may befall me in this case, If I refuse to wed Demetrius. Either to die the death, or to abjure For ever the society of men. Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires; Know of your youth, examine well your blood, Whe'r, if you yield not to your father's choice, You can endure the livery of a nun, For aye to be in shady cloister mew'd, To live a barren sister all your life, Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon. Thrice blessed they that master so their blood, To undergo such maiden pilgrimage; But earthlier happy is the rose distill'd, Than that which withering on the virgin thorn Grows, lives, and dies, in single blessedness. So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord, Ere I will yield my virgin patent up Unto his lordship, whose unwished yoke My soul consents not to give sovereignty. Take time to pause; and, by the next new moon,â€” The sealing-day betwixt my love and me For everlasting bond of fellowship,â€” Upon that day either prepare to die For disobedience to your father's will, Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would; Or on Diana's altar to protest For aye austerity and single life. Relent, sweet Hermia; and, Lysander, yield Thy crazed title to my certain right. You have her father's love, Demetrius; Let me have Hermia's: do you marry him. Scornful Lysander! true, he hath my love, And what is mine my love shall render him; And she is mine, and all my right of her I do estate unto Demetrius. I am, my lord, as well deriv'd as he, As well possess'd; my love is more than his; My fortunes every way as fairly rank'd If not with vantage, as Demetrius'; And, which is more than all these boasts can be, I am belov'd of beauteous Hermia. Why should not I then prosecute my right? Demetrius, I'll avouch it to his head, Made love to Nedar's daughter, Helena, And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes, Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry, Upon this spotted and inconstant man. I must confess that I have heard so much, And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof; But, being over-full of self-affairs, My mind did lose it. But, Demetrius, come; And come, Egeus; you shall go with me, I have some private schooling for you both. For you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself To fit your fancies to your father's will, Or else the law of Athens yields you up, Which by no means we may extenuate, To death, or to a vow of single life. Come, my Hippolyta: what cheer, my love? Demetrius and Egeus, go along: I must employ you in some business Against our nuptial, and confer with you Of something nearly that concerns yourselves. With duty and desire we follow you. How now, my love! Why is your cheek so pale? How chance the roses there do fade so fast? Belike for want of rain, which I could well Beteem them from the tempest of mine eyes. Ay me! for aught that ever I could read, Could ever hear by tale or history, The course of true love never did run smooth; But, either it was different in blood,â€” O cross! too high to be enthrall'd to low. Or else misgraffed in respect of years,â€” O spite! too old to be engag'd to young. Or else it stood upon the choice of friends,â€” O hell! to choose love by another's eye. Or, if there were a sympathy in choice, War, death, or sickness did lay siege to it, Making it momentany as a sound, Swift as a shadow, short as any dream, Brief as the lightning in the collied night, That, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and earth, And ere a man hath power to say, 'Behold!' The jaws of darkness do devour it up: So quick bright things come to confusion. If then true lovers have been ever cross'd, It stands as an edict in destiny: Then let us teach our trial patience, Because it is a customary cross, As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs, Wishes and tears, poor fancy's followers. A good persuasion: therefore, hear me, Hermia. I have a widow aunt, a dowager Of great revenue, and she hath no child: From Athens is her house remote seven leagues; And she respects me as her only son. There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee, And to that place the sharp Athenian law Cannot pursue us. If thou lov'st me then, Steal forth thy father's house to-morrow night, And in the wood, a league without the town, Where I did meet thee once with Helena, To do observance to a morn of May, There will I stay for thee. My good Lysander! I swear to thee by Cupid's strongest bow, By his best arrow with the golden head, By the simplicity of Venus' doves, By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves, And by that fire which burn'd the Carthage queen, When the false Troyan under sail was seen, By all the vows that ever men have broke,â€” In number more than ever women spoke,â€” In that same place thou hast appointed me, To-morrow truly will I meet with thee. Keep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena. God speed fair Helena! Whither away? Call you me fair? that fair again unsay. Demetrius loves your fair: O happy fair! Your eyes are lode-stars! and your tongue's sweet air More tuneable than lark to shepherd's ear, When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear. Sickness is catching: O! were favour so, Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go; My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye, My tongue should catch your tongue's sweet melody. Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated, The rest I'd give to be to you translated. O! teach me how you look, and with what art You sway the motion of Demetrius' heart. I frown upon him, yet he loves me still. O! that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill. I give him curses, yet he gives me love. O! that my prayers could such affection move. The more I hate, the more he follows me. The more I love, the more he hateth me. His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine. None, but your beauty: would that fault were mine! Take comfort: he no more shall see my face; Lysander and myself will fly this place. Before the time I did Lysander see, Seem'd Athens as a paradise to me: O! then, what graces in my love do dwell, That he hath turn'd a heaven unto a hell. Helen, to you our minds we will unfold. To-morrow night, when PhÅ“be doth behold Her silver visage in the wat'ry glass, Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,â€” A time that lovers' flights doth still conceal,â€” Through Athens' gates have we devis'd to steal. And in the wood, where often you and I Upon faint primrose-beds were wont to lie, Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet, There my Lysander and myself shall meet; And thence from Athens turn away our eyes, To seek new friends and stranger companies. Farewell, sweet playfellow: pray thou for us; And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius! Keep word, Lysander: we must starve our sight From lovers' food till morrow deep midnight. I will, my Hermia.â€” Helena, adieu: As you on him, Demetrius dote on you! How happy some o'er other some can be! Through Athens I am thought as fair as she; But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so; He will not know what all but he do know; And as he errs, doting on Hermia's eyes, So I, admiring of his qualities. Things base and vile, holding no quantity, Love can transpose to form and dignity. Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind, And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind. Nor hath Love's mind of any judgment taste; Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste: And therefore is Love said to be a child, Because in choice he is so oft beguil'd. As waggish boys in game themselves forswear, So the boy Love is perjur'd every where; For ere Demetrius look'd on Hermia's eyne, He hail'd down oaths that he was only mine; And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt, So he dissolv'd, and showers of oaths did melt. I will go tell him of fair Hermia's flight: Then to the wood will he to-morrow night Pursue her; and for this intelligence If I have thanks, it is a dear expense: But herein mean I to enrich my pain, To have his sight thither and back again. Is all our company here? You were best to call them generally, man by man, according to the scrip. Here is the scroll of every man's name, which is thought fit, through all Athens, to play in our interlude before the duke and the duchess on his wedding-day at night. First, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats on; then read the names of the actors, and so grow to a point. Marry, our play is, The most lamentable comedy, and most cruel death of Pyramus and Thisby. A very good piece of work, I assure you, and a merry. Now, good Peter Quince, call forth your actors by the scroll. Masters, spread yourselves. Answer as I call you. Nick Bottom, the weaver. Ready. Name what part I am for, and proceed. You, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus. What is Pyramus? a lover, or a tyrant? A lover, that kills himself most gallantly for love. That will ask some tears in the true performing of it: if I do it, let the audience look to their eyes; I will move storms, I will condole in some measure. To the rest: yet my chief humour is for a tyrant. I could play Ercles rarely, or a part to tear a cat in, to make all split. The raging rocks And shivering shocks Shall break the locks Of prison gates: And Phibbus' car Shall shine from far And make and mar The foolish Fates. This was lofty! Now name the rest of the players. This is Ercles' vein, a tyrant's vein; a lover is more condoling. Francis Flute, the bellows-mender. Here, Peter Quince. You must take Thisby on you. What is Thisby? a wandering knight? It is the lady that Pyramus must love. Nay, faith, let not me play a woman; I have a beard coming. That's all one: you shall play it in a mask, and you may speak as small as you will. An I may hide my face, let me play Thisby too. I'll speak in a monstrous little voice, 'Thisne, Thisne!' 'Ah, Pyramus, my lover dear; thy Thisby dear, and lady dear!' No, no; you must play Pyramus; and Flute, you Thisby. Well, proceed. Robin Starveling, the tailor. Here, Peter Quince. Robin Starveling, you must play Thisby's mother. Tom Snout, the tinker. Here, Peter Quince. You, Pyramus's father; myself, Thisby's father; Snug, the joiner, you the lion's part: and, I hope, here is a play fitted. Have you the lion's part written? pray you, if it be, give it me, for I am slow of study. You may do it extempore, for it is nothing but roaring. Let me play the lion too. I will roar, that I will do any man's heart good to hear me; I will roar, that I will make the duke say, 'Let him roar again, let him roar again.' An you should do it too terribly, you would fright the duchess and the ladies, that they would shriek; and that were enough to hang us all. That would hang us, every mother's son. I grant you, friends, if that you should fright the ladies out of their wits, they would have no more discretion but to hang us; but I will aggravate my voice so that I will roar you as gently as any sucking dove; I will roar you as 'twere any nightingale. You can play no part but Pyramus; for Pyramus is a sweet-faced man; a proper man, as one shall see in a summer's day; a most lovely, gentleman-like man; therefore, you must needs play Pyramus. Well, I will undertake it. What beard were I best to play it in? Why, what you will. I will discharge it in either your straw-colour beard, your orange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grain beard, or your French-crown colour beard, your perfect yellow. Some of your French crowns have no hair at all, and then you will play bare-faced. But masters, here are your parts; and I am to entreat you, request you, and desire you, to con them by to-morrow night, and meet me in the palace wood, a mile without the town, by moonlight: there will we rehearse; for if we meet in the city, we shall be dogged with company, and our devices known. In the meantime I will draw a bill of properties, such as our play wants. I pray you, fail me not. We will meet; and there we may rehearse more obscenely and courageously. Take pains; be perfect; adieu. At the duke's oak we meet. Enough; hold, or cut bow-strings. How now, spirit! whither wander you? Over hill, over dale, Thorough bush, thorough brier, Over park, over pale, Thorough flood, thorough fire, I do wander every where, Swifter than the moone's sphere; And I serve the fairy queen, To dew her orbs upon the green: The cowslips tall her pensioners be; In their gold coats spots you see; Those be rubies, fairy favours, In their freckles live their savours: I must go seek some dew-drops here, And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear. Farewell, thou lob of spirits: I'll be gone; Our queen and all her elves come here anon. The king doth keep his revels here to-night. Take heed the queen come not within his sight; For Oberon is passing fell and wrath, Because that she as her attendant hath A lovely boy, stol'n from an Indian king; She never had so sweet a changeling; And jealous Oberon would have the child Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild; But she, perforce, withholds the loved boy, Crowns him with flowers, and makes him all her joy. And now they never meet in grove, or green, By fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen, But they do square; that all their elves, for fear, Creep into acorn-cups and hide them there. Either I mistake your shape and making quite, Or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite Call'd Robin Goodfellow: are you not he That frights the maidens of the villagery; Skim milk, and sometimes labour in the quern, And bootless make the breathless housewife churn; And sometime make the drink to bear no barm; Mislead night-wanderers, laughing at their harm? Those that Hobgoblin call you and sweet Puck, You do their work, and they shall have good luck: Are you not he? Fairy, thou speak'st aright; I am that merry wanderer of the night. I jest to Oberon, and make him smile When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile, Neighing in likeness of a filly foal: And sometime lurk I in a gossip's bowl, In very likeness of a roasted crab; And, when she drinks, against her lips I bob And on her wither'd dewlap pour the ale. The wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale, Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me; Then slip I from her bum, down topples she, And 'tailor' cries, and falls into a cough; And then the whole quire hold their hips and loff; And waxen in their mirth, and neeze, and swear A merrier hour was never wasted there. But, room, fairy! here comes Oberon. And here my mistress. Would that he were gone! Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania. What! jealous Oberon. Fairies, skip hence: I have forsworn his bed and company. Tarry, rash wanton! am not I thy lord? Then, I must be thy lady; but I know When thou hast stol'n away from fairy land, And in the shape of Corin sat all day, Playing on pipes of corn, and versing love To amorous Phillida. Why art thou here, Come from the furthest steppe of India? But that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon, Your buskin'd mistress and your warrior love, To Theseus must be wedded, and you come To give their bed joy and prosperity. How canst thou thus for shame, Titania, Glance at my credit with Hippolyta, Knowing I know thy love to Theseus? Didst thou not lead him through the glimmering night From Perigouna, whom he ravished? And make him with fair Ã†gle break his faith, With Ariadne, and Antiopa? These are the forgeries of jealousy: And never, since the middle summer's spring, Met we on hill, in dale, forest, or mead, By paved fountain, or by rushy brook, Or in the beached margent of the sea, To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind, But with thy brawls thou hast disturb'd our sport. Therefore the winds, piping to us in vain, As in revenge, have suck'd up from the sea Contagious fogs; which, falling in the land, Have every pelting river made so proud That they have overborne their continents: The ox hath therefore stretch'd his yoke in vain, The ploughman lost his sweat, and the green corn Hath rotted ere his youth attain'd a beard: The fold stands empty in the drowned field, And crows are fatted with the murrion flock; The nine men's morris is fill'd up with mud, And the quaint mazes in the wanton green For lack of tread are undistinguishable: The human mortals want their winter here: No night is now with hymn or carol blest: Therefore the moon, the governess of floods, Pale in her anger, washes all the air, That rheumatic diseases do abound: And thorough this distemperature we see The seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts Fall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose, And on old Hiems' thin and icy crown An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds Is, as in mockery, set. The spring, the summer, The childing autumn, angry winter, change Their wonted liveries, and the mazed world, By their increase, now knows not which is which. And this same progeny of evil comes From our debate, from our dissension: We are their parents and original. Do you amend it then; it lies in you. Why should Titania cross her Oberon? I do but beg a little changeling boy, To be my henchman. Set your heart at rest; The fairy land buys not the child of me. His mother was a votaress of my order: And, in the spiced Indian air, by night, Full often hath she gossip'd by my side, And sat with me on Neptune's yellow sands, Marking the embarked traders on the flood; When we have laugh'd to see the sails conceive And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind; Which she, with pretty and with swimming gait Following,â€”her womb then rich with my young squire,â€” Would imitate, and sail upon the land, To fetch me trifles, and return again, As from a voyage, rich with merchandise. But she, being mortal, of that boy did die; And for her sake I do rear up her boy, And for her sake I will not part with him. How long within this wood intend you stay? Perchance, till after Theseus' weddingday. If you will patiently dance in our round, And see our moonlight revels, go with us; If not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts. Give me that boy, and I will go with thee. Not for thy fairy kingdom. Fairies, away! We shall chide downright, if I longer stay. Well, go thy way: thou shalt not from this grove Till I torment thee for this injury. My gentle Puck, come hither. Thou remember'st Since once I sat upon a promontory, And heard a mermaid on a dolphin's back Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath, That the rude sea grew civil at her song, And certain stars shot madly from their spheres To hear the sea-maid's music. I remember. That very time I saw, but thou couldst not, Flying between the cold moon and the earth, Cupid all arm'd: a certain aim he took At a fair vestal throned by the west, And loos'd his love-shaft smartly from his bow, As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts; But I might see young Cupid's fiery shaft Quench'd in the chaste beams of the wat'ry moon, And the imperial votaress passed on, In maiden meditation, fancy-free. Yet mark'd I where the bolt of Cupid fell: It fell upon a little western flower, Before milk-white, now purple with love's wound, And maidens call it, Love-in-idleness. Fetch me that flower; the herb I show'd thee once: The juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid Will make or man or woman madly dote Upon the next live creature that it sees. Fetch me this herb; and be thou here again Ere the leviathan can swim a league. I'll put a girdle round about the earth In forty minutes. Having once this juice I'll watch Titania when she is asleep, And drop the liquor of it in her eyes: The next thing then she waking looks upon, Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull, On meddling monkey, or on busy ape, She shall pursue it with the soul of love: And ere I take this charm off from her sight, As I can take it with another herb, I'll make her render up her page to me. But who comes here? I am invisible, And I will overhear their conference. I love thee not, therefore pursue me not. Where is Lysander and fair Hermia? The one I'll slay, the other slayeth me. Thou told'st me they were stol'n into this wood; And here am I, and wood within this wood, Because I cannot meet my Hermia. Hence! get thee gone, and follow me no more. You draw me, you hard-hearted adamant: But yet you draw not iron, for my heart Is true as steel: leave you your power to draw, And I shall have no power to follow you. Do I entice you? Do I speak you fair? Or, rather, do I not in plainest truth Tell you I do not nor I cannot love you? And even for that do I love you the more. I am your spaniel; and, Demetrius, The more you beat me, I will fawn on you: Use me but as your spaniel, spurn me, strike me, Neglect me, lose me; only give me leave, Unworthy as I am, to follow you. What worser place can I beg in your love, And yet a place of high respect with me, Than to be used as you use your dog? Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit, For I am sick when I do look on you. And I am sick when I look not on you. You do impeach your modesty too much, To leave the city, and commit yourself Into the hands of one that loves you not; To trust the opportunity of night And the ill counsel of a desert place With the rich worth of your virginity. Your virtue is my privilege: for that It is not night when I do see your face, Therefore I think I am not in the night; Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company, For you in my respect are all the world: Then how can it be said I am alone, When all the world is here to look on me? I'll run from thee and hide me in the brakes, And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts. The wildest hath not such a heart as you. Run when you will, the story shall be chang'd; Apollo flies, and Daphne holds the chase; The dove pursues the griffin; the mild hind Makes speed to catch the tiger: bootless speed, When cowardice pursues and valour flies. I will not stay thy questions: let me go; Or, if thou follow me, do not believe But I shall do thee mischief in the wood. Ay, in the temple, in the town, the field, You do me mischief. Fie, Demetrius! Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex. We cannot fight for love, as men may do; We should be woo'd and were not made to woo. I'll follow thee and make a heaven of hell, To die upon the hand I love so well. Fare thee well, nymph: ere he do leave this grove, Thou shalt fly him, and he shall seek thy love. Hast thou the flower there? Welcome, wanderer. Ay, there it is. I pray thee, give it me. I know a bank whereon the wild thyme blows, Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine, With sweet musk-roses, and with eglantine: There sleeps Titania some time of the night, Lull'd in these flowers with dances and delight; And there the snake throws her enamell'd skin, Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in: And with the juice of this I'll streak her eyes, And make her full of hateful fantasies. Take thou some of it, and seek through this grove: A sweet Athenian lady is in love With a disdainful youth: anoint his eyes; But do it when the next thing he espies May be the lady. Thou shalt know the man By the Athenian garments he hath on. Effect it with some care, that he may prove More fond on her than she upon her love. And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow. Fear not, my lord, your servant shall do so. Come, now a roundel and a fairy song; Then, for the third of a minute, hence; Some to kill cankers in the musk-rose buds, Some war with rere-mice for their leathern wings, To make my small elves coats, and some keep back The clamorous owl, that nightly hoots, and wonders At our quaint spirits. Sing me now asleep; Then to your offices, and let me rest. The Fairies sing. I. You spotted snakes with double tongue, Thorny hedge-hogs, be not seen; Newts, and blind-worms, do no wrong; Come not near our fairy queen. Philomel, with melody, Sing in our sweet lullaby: Lulla, lulla, lullaby; lulla, lulla, lullaby: Never harm, Nor spell, nor charm, Come our lovely lady nigh; So, good night, with lullaby. II. Weaving spiders come not here; Hence, you long-legg'd spinners, hence! Beetles black, approach not near; Worm nor snail, do no offence. Philomel, with melody, &c. Hence, away! now all is well. One aloof stand sentinel. What thou seest when thou dost wake, Do it for thy true-love take; Love and languish for his sake: Be it ounce, or cat, or bear, Pard, or boar with bristled hair, In thy eye that shall appear When thou wak'st, it is thy dear. Wake when some vile thing is near. Fair love, you faint with wandering in the wood; And to speak troth, I have forgot our way: We'll rest us, Hermia, if you think it good, And tarry for the comfort of the day. Be it so, Lysander: find you out a bed, For I upon this bank will rest my head. One turf shall serve as pillow for us both; One heart, one bed, two bosoms, and one troth. Nay, good Lysander; for my sake, my dear, Lie further off yet, do not lie so near. O! take the sense, sweet, of my innocence, Love takes the meaning in love's conference. I mean that my heart unto yours is knit, So that but one heart we can make of it; Two bosoms interchained with an oath; So then two bosoms and a single troth. Then by your side no bed-room me deny, For, lying so, Hermia, I do not lie. Lysander riddles very prettily: Now much beshrew my manners and my pride, If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied. But, gentle friend, for love and courtesy Lie further off; in human modesty, Such separation as may well be said Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid, So far be distant; and, good night, sweet friend. Thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life end! Amen, amen, to that fair prayer, say I; And then end life when I end loyalty! Here is my bed: sleep give thee all his rest! With half that wish the wisher's eyes be press'd! Through the forest have I gone, But Athenian found I none, On whose eyes I might approve This flower's force in stirring love. Night and silence! who is here? Weeds of Athens he doth wear: This is he, my master said, Despised the Athenian maid; And here the maiden, sleeping sound, On the dank and dirty ground. Pretty soul! she durst not lie Near this lack-love, this kill-courtesy. Churl, upon thy eyes I throw All the power this charm doth owe. When thou wak'st, let love forbid Sleep his seat on thy eyelid: So awake when I am gone; For I must now to Oberon. Stay, though thou kill me, sweet Demetrius. I charge thee, hence, and do not haunt me thus. O! wilt thou darkling leave me? do not so. Stay, on thy peril: I alone will go. O! I am out of breath in this fond chase. The more my prayer, the lesser is my grace. Happy is Hermia, wheresoe'er she lies; For she hath blessed and attractive eyes. How came her eyes so bright? Not with salt tears: If so, my eyes are oftener wash'd than hers. No, no, I am as ugly as a bear; For beasts that meet me run away for fear; Therefore no marvel though Demetrius Do, as a monster, fly my presence thus. What wicked and dissembling glass of mine Made me compare with Hermia's sphery eyne? But who is here? Lysander! on the ground! Dead? or asleep? I see no blood, no wound. Lysander, if you live, good sir, awake. And run through fire I will for thy sweet sake. Transparent Helena! Nature shows art, That through thy bosom makes me see thy heart. Where is Demetrius? O! how fit a word Is that vile name to perish on my sword. Do not say so, Lysander; say not so. What though he love your Hermia? Lord! what though? Yet Hermia still loves you: then be content. Content with Hermia! No: I do repent The tedious minutes I with her have spent. Not Hermia, but Helena I love: Who will not change a raven for a dove? The will of man is by his reason sway'd, And reason says you are the worthier maid. Things growing are not ripe until their season; So I, being young, till now ripe not to reason; And touching now the point of human skill, Reason becomes the marshal to my will, And leads me to your eyes; where I o'erlook Love's stories written in love's richest book. Wherefore was I to this keen mockery born? When at your hands did I deserve this scorn? Is't not enough, is't not enough, young man, That I did never, no, nor never can, Deserve a sweet look from Demetrius' eye, But you must flout my insufficiency? Good troth, you do me wrong, good sooth, you do, In such disdainful manner me to woo. But fare you well: perforce I must confess I thought you lord of more true gentleness. O! that a lady of one man refus'd, Should of another therefore be abus'd. She sees not Hermia. Hermia, sleep thou there; And never mayst thou come Lysander near. For, as a surfeit of the sweetest things The deepest loathing to the stomach brings; Or, as the heresies that men do leave Are hated most of those they did deceive: So thou, my surfeit and my heresy, Of all be hated, but the most of me! And, all my powers, address your love and might To honour Helen, and to be her knight. Help me, Lysander, help me! do thy best To pluck this crawling serpent from my breast. Ay me, for pity! what a dream was here! Lysander, look how I do quake with fear: Methought a serpent eat my heart away, And you sat smiling at his cruel prey. Lysander! what! remov'd?â€”Lysander! lord! What! out of hearing? gone? no sound, no word? Alack! where are you? speak, an if you hear; Speak, of all loves! I swound almost with fear. No! then I well perceive you are not nigh: Either death or you I'll find immediately. Are we all met? Pat, pat; and here's a marvellous convenient place for our rehearsal. This green plot shall be our stage, this hawthorn-brake our tiring-house; and we will do it in action as we will do it before the duke. Peter Quince,â€” What sayst thou, bully Bottom? There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and Thisby that will never please. First, Pyramus must draw a sword to kill himself, which the ladies cannot abide. How answer you that? By'r lakin, a parlous fear. I believe we must leave the killing out, when all is done. Not a whit: I have a device to make all well. Write me a prologue; and let the prologue seem to say, we will do no harm with our swords, and that Pyramus is not killed indeed; and, for the more better assurance, tell them that I, Pyramus, am not Pyramus, but Bottom the weaver: this will put them out of fear. Well, we will have such a prologue, and it shall be written in eight and six. No, make it two more: let it be written in eight and eight. Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion? I fear it, I promise you. Masters, you ought to consider with yourselves: to bring in,â€”God shield us!â€”a lion among ladies, is a most dreadful thing; for there is not a more fearful wild-fowl than your lion living, and we ought to look to it. Therefore, another prologue must tell he is not a lion. Nay, you must name his name, and half his face must be seen through the lion's neck; and he himself must speak through, saying thus, or to the same defect, 'Ladies,' or, 'Fair ladies,' 'I would wish you,' or, 'I would request you,' or, 'I would entreat you, not to fear, not to tremble: my life for yours. If you think I come hither as a lion, it were pity of my life: no, I am no such thing: I am a man as other men are;' and there indeed let him name his name, and tell them plainly he is Snug the joiner. Well, it shall be so. But there is two hard things, that is, to bring the moonlight into a chamber; for, you know, Pyramus and Thisby meet by moonlight. Doth the moon shine that night we play our play? A calendar, a calendar! look in the almanack; find out moonshine, find out moonshine. Yes, it doth shine that night. Why, then may you leave a casement of the great chamber-window, where we play, open; and the moon may shine in at the casement. Ay; or else one must come in with a bush of thorns and a lanthorn, and say he comes to disfigure, or to present, the person of Moonshine. Then, there is another thing: we must have a wall in the great chamber; for Pyramus and Thisby, says the story, did talk through the chink of a wall. You can never bring in a wall. What say you, Bottom? Some man or other must present Wall; and let him have some plaster, or some loam, or some rough-cast about him, to signify wall; and let him hold his fingers thus, and through that cranny shall Pyramus and Thisby whisper. If that may be, than all is well. Come, sit down, every mother's son, and rehearse your parts. Pyramus, you begin: when you have spoken your speech, enter into that brake; and so every one according to his cue. What hempen home-spuns have we swaggering here, So near the cradle of the fairy queen? What! a play toward; I'll be an auditor; An actor too perhaps, if I see cause. Speak, Pyramus.â€”Thisby, stand forth. Thisby, the flowers have odious savours sweet,â€” Odorous, odorous. â€”odours savours sweet: So hath thy breath, my dearest Thisby dear. But hark, a voice! stay thou but here awhile, And by and by I will to thee appear. A stranger Pyramus than e'er play'd here! Must I speak now? Ay, marry, must you; for you must understand, he goes but to see a noise that he heard, and is to come again. Most radiant Pyramus, most lily-white of hue, Of colour like the red rose on triumphant brier, Most brisky juvenal, and eke most lovely Jew, As true as truest horse that yet would never tire, I'll meet thee, Pyramus, at Ninny's tomb. 'Ninus' tomb,' man. Why, you must not speak that yet; that you answer to Pyramus: you speak all your part at once, cues and all. Pyramus, enter: your cue is past; it is 'never tire.' O!â€”As true as truest horse, that yet would never tire. If I were, fair Thisby, I were only thine. O monstrous! O strange! we are haunted. Pray, masters! fly, masters!â€”Help! I'll follow you, I'll lead you about a round, Through bog, through bush, through brake, through brier: Sometime a horse I'll be, sometime a hound, A hog, a headless bear, sometime a fire; And neigh, and bark, and grunt, and roar, and burn, Like horse, hound, hog, bear, fire, at every turn. Why do they run away? this is a knavery of them to make me afeard. O Bottom, thou art changed! what do I see on thee? What do you see? you see an ass-head of your own, do you? Bless thee, Bottom! bless thee! thou art translated. I see their knavery: this is to make an ass of me; to fright me, if they could. But I will not stir from this place, do what they can: I will walk up and down here, and I will sing, that they shall hear I am not afraid. The ousel-cock, so black of hue, With orange-tawny bill, The throstle with his note so true, The wren with little quill. What angel wakes me from my flowery bed? The finch, the sparrow, and the lark, The plain-song cuckoo gray, Whose note full many a man doth mark, And dares not answer, nay; for indeed, who would set his wit to so foolish a bird? who would give a bird the lie, though he cry 'cuckoo' never so? I pray thee, gentle mortal, sing again: Mine ear is much enamour'd of thy note; So is mine eye enthralled to thy shape; And thy fair virtue's force, perforce, doth move me, On the first view, to say, to swear, I love thee. Methinks, mistress, you should have little reason for that: and yet, to say the truth, reason and love keep little company together now-a-days. The more the pity, that some honest neighbours will not make them friends. Nay, I can gleek upon occasion. Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful. Not so, neither; but if I had wit enough to get out of this wood, I have enough to serve mine own turn. Out of this wood do not desire to go: Thou shalt remain here, whe'r thou wilt or no. I am a spirit of no common rate; The summer still doth tend upon my state; And I do love thee: therefore, go with me; I'll give thee fairies to attend on thee, And they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep, And sing, while thou on pressed flowers dost sleep: And I will purge thy mortal grossness so That thou shalt like an airy spirit go. Pease-blossom! Cobweb! Moth! and Mustardseed! Ready. And I. And I. And I. Where shall we go? Be kind and courteous to this gentleman; Hop in his walks, and gambol in his eyes; Feed him with apricocks and dewberries, With purple grapes, green figs, and mulberries. The honey-bags steal from the humble-bees, And for night-tapers crop their waxen thighs, And light them at the fiery glow-worm's eyes, To have my love to bed, and to arise; And pluck the wings from painted butterflies To fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes: Nod to him, elves, and do him courtesies. Hail, mortal! Hail! Hail! Hail! I cry your worships mercy, heartily: I beseech your worship's name. Cobweb. I shall desire you of more acquaintance, good Master Cobweb: if I out my finger, I shall make bold with you. Your name, honest gentleman? Pease-blossom. I pray you, commend me to Mistress Squash, your mother, and to Master Peascod, your father. Good Master Pease-blossom, I shall desire you of more acquaintance too. Your name, I beseech you, sir? Mustard-seed. Good Master Mustard-seed, I know your patience well: that same cowardly, giant-like ox-beef hath devoured many a gentleman of your house. I promise you, your kindred hath made my eyes water ere now. I desire you of more acquaintance, good Master Mustard-seed. Come, wait upon him; lead him to my bower. The moon methinks, looks with a watery eye; And when she weeps, weeps every little flower, Lamenting some enforced chastity. Tie up my love's tongue, bring him silently. I wonder if Titania be awak'd; Then, what it was that next came in her eye, Which she must dote on in extremity. Here comes my messenger. How now, mad spirit! What night-rule now about this haunted grove? My mistress with a monster is in love. Near to her close and consecrated bower, While she was in her dull and sleeping hour, A crew of patches, rude mechanicals, That work for bread upon Athenian stalls, Were met together to rehearse a play Intended for great Theseus' nuptial day. The shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort, Who Pyramus presented in their sport Forsook his scene, and enter'd in a brake, When I did him at this advantage take; An ass's nowl I fixed on his head: Anon his Thisbe must be answered, And forth my mimick comes. When they him spy, As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye, Or russet-pated choughs, many in sort, Rising and cawing at the gun's report, Sever themselves, and madly sweep the sky; So, at his sight, away his fellows fly, And, at our stamp, here o'er and o'er one falls; He murder cries, and help from Athens calls. Their sense thus weak, lost with their fears thus strong, Made senseless things begin to do them wrong; For briers and thorns at their apparel snatch; Some sleeves, some hats, from yielders all things catch. I led them on in this distracted fear, And left sweet Pyramus translated there; When in that moment, so it came to pass, Titania wak'd and straightway lov'd an ass. This falls out better than I could devise. But hast thou yet latch'd the Athenian's eyes With the love-juice, as I did bid thee do? I took him sleeping,â€”that is finish'd too,â€” And the Athenian woman by his side; That, when he wak'd, of force she must be ey'd. Stand close: this is the same Athenian. This is the woman; but not this the man. O! why rebuke you him that loves you so? Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe. Now I but chide; but I should use thee worse, For thou, I fear, hast given me cause to curse. If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep, Being o'er shoes in blood, plunge in knee deep, And kill me too. The sun was not so true unto the day As he to me. Would he have stol'n away From sleeping Hermia? I'll believe as soon This whole earth may be bor'd, and that the moon May through the centre creep, and so displease Her brother's noontide with the Antipodes. It cannot be but thou hast murder'd him; So should a murderer look, so dead, so grim. So should the murder'd look, and so should I, Pierc'd through the heart with your stern cruelty; Yet you, the murderer, look as bright, as clear, As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere. What's this to my Lysander? where is he? Ah! good Demetrius, wilt thou give him me? I had rather give his carcass to my hounds. Out, dog! out, cur! thou driv'st me past the bounds Of maiden's patience. Hast thou slain him then? Henceforth be never number'd among men! O! once tell true, tell true, e'en for my sake; Durst thou have look'd upon him being awake, And hast thou kill'd him sleeping? O brave touch! Could not a worm, an adder, do so much? An adder did it; for with doubler tongue Than thine, thou serpent, never adder stung. You spend your passion on a mispris'd mood: I am not guilty of Lysander's blood, Nor is he dead, for aught that I can tell. I pray thee, tell me then that he is well. An if I could, what should I get therefore? A privilege never to see me more. And from thy hated presence part I so; See me no more, whe'r he be dead or no. There is no following her in this fierce vein: Here therefore for awhile I will remain. So sorrow's heaviness doth heavier grow For debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe; Which now in some slight measure it will pay, If for his tender here I make some stay. What hast thou done? thou hast mistaken quite, And laid the love-juice on some true-love's sight: Of thy misprision must perforce ensue Some true-love turn'd, and not a false turn'd true. Then fate o'er-rules, that, one man holding troth, A million fail, confounding oath on oath. About the wood go swifter than the wind, And Helena of Athens look thou find: All fancy-sick she is, and pale of cheer With sighs of love, that cost the fresh blood dear. By some illusion see thou bring her here: I'll charm his eyes against she do appear. I go, I go; look how I go; Swifter than arrow from the Tartar's bow. Flower of this purple dye, Hit with Cupid's archery, Sink in apple of his eye. When his love he doth espy, Let her shine as gloriously As the Venus of the sky. When thou wak'st, if she be by, Beg of her for remedy. Captain of our fairy band, Helena is here at hand, And the youth, mistook by me, Pleading for a lover's fee. Shall we their fond pageant see? Lord, what fools these mortals be! Stand aside: the noise they make Will cause Demetrius to awake. Then will two at once woo one; That must needs be sport alone; And those things do best please me That befall preposterously. Why should you think that I should woo in scorn? Scorn and derision never come in tears: Look, when I vow, I weep; and vows so born, In their nativity all truth appears. How can these things in me seem scorn to you, Bearing the badge of faith to prove them true? You do advance your cunning more and more. When truth kills truth, O devilish-holy fray! These vows are Hermia's: will you give her o'er? Weigh oath with oath, and you will nothing weigh: Your vows, to her and me, put in two scales, Will even weigh, and both as light as tales. I had no judgment when to her I swore. Nor none, in my mind, now you give her o'er. Demetrius loves her, and he loves not you. O Helen! goddess, nymph, perfect, divine! To what, my love, shall I compare thine eyne? Crystal is muddy. O! how ripe in show Thy lips, those kissing cherries, tempting grow, This pure congealed white, high Taurus' snow, Fann'd with the eastern wind, turns to a crow When thou hold'st up thy hand. O! let me kiss That princess of pure white, this seal of bliss. O spite! O hell! I see you all are bent To set against me for your merriment: If you were civil and knew courtesy, You would not do me thus much injury. Can you not hate me, as I know you do, But you must join in souls to mock me too? If you were men, as men you are in show, You would not use a gentle lady so; To vow, and swear, and superpraise my parts, When I am sure you hate me with your hearts. You both are rivals, and love Hermia, And now both rivals, to mock Helena: A trim exploit, a manly enterprise, To conjure tears up in a poor maid's eyes With your derision! none of noble sort Would so offend a virgin, and extort A poor soul's patience, all to make you sport. You are unkind, Demetrius; be not so; For you love Hermia; this you know I know: And here, with all good will, with all my heart, In Hermia's love I yield you up my part; And yours of Helena to me bequeath, Whom I do love, and will do to my death. Never did mockers waste more idle breath. Lysander, keep thy Hermia; I will none: If e'er I lov'd her, all that love is gone. My heart with her but as guest wise sojourn'd, And now to Helen it is home return'd, There to remain. Helen, it is not so. Disparage not the faith thou dost not know, Lest to thy peril thou aby it dear. Look! where thy love comes: yonder is thy dear. Dark night, that from the eye his function takes, The ear more quick of apprehension makes; Wherein it doth impair the seeing sense, It pays the hearing double recompense. Thou art not by mine eye, Lysander, found; Mine ear, I thank it, brought me to thy sound. But why unkindly didst thou leave me so? Why should he stay, whom love doth press to go? What love could press Lysander from my side? Lysander's love, that would not let him bide, Fair Helena, who more engilds the night Than all yon fiery oes and eyes of light. Why seek'st thou me? could not this make thee know, The hate I bear thee made me leave thee so? You speak not as you think: it cannot be. Lo! she is one of this confederacy. Now I perceive they have conjoin'd all three To fashion this false sport in spite of me. Injurious Hermia! most ungrateful maid! Have you conspir'd, have you with these contriv'd To bait me with this foul derision? Is all the counsel that we two have shar'd, The sister-vows, the hours that we have spent, When we have chid the hasty-footed time For parting us, O! is it all forgot? All school-days' friendship, childhood innocence? We, Hermia, like two artificial gods, Have with our neelds created both one flower, Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion, Both warbling of one song, both in one key, As if our hands, our sides, voices, and minds, Had been incorporate. So we grew together, Like to a double cherry, seeming parted, But yet an union in partition; Two lovely berries moulded on one stem; So, with two seeming bodies, but one heart; Two of the first, like coats in heraldry, Due but to one, and crowned with one crest. And will you rent our ancient love asunder, To join with men in scorning your poor friend? It is not friendly, 'tis not maidenly: Our sex, as well as I, may chide you for it, Though I alone do feel the injury. I am amazed at your passionate words. I scorn you not: it seems that you scorn me. Have you not set Lysander, as in scorn, To follow me and praise my eyes and face, And made your other love, Demetrius,â€” Who even but now did spurn me with his foot,â€” To call me goddess, nymph, divine and rare, Precious, celestial? Wherefore speaks he this To her he hates? and wherefore doth Lysander Deny your love, so rich within his soul, And tender me, forsooth, affection, But by your setting on, by your consent? What though I be not so in grace as you, So hung upon with love, so fortunate, But miserable most to love unlov'd? This you should pity rather than despise. I understand not what you mean by this. Ay, do, persever, counterfeit sad looks, Make mouths upon me when I turn my back; Wink each at other; hold the sweet jest up: This sport, well carried, shall be chronicled. If you have any pity, grace, or manners, You would not make me such an argument. But, fare ye well: 'tis partly mine own fault, Which death or absence soon shall remedy. Stay, gentle Helena! hear my excuse: My love, my life, my soul, fair Helena! O excellent! Sweet, do not scorn her so. If she cannot entreat, I can compel. Thou canst compel no more than she entreat: Thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers. Helen, I love thee; by my life, I do: I swear by that which I will lose for thee, To prove him false that says I love thee not. I say I love thee more than he can do. If thou say so, withdraw, and prove it too. Quick, come! Lysander, whereto tends all this? Away, you Ethiop! No, no, he'll . . . Seem to break loose; take on, as you would follow, But yet come not: you are a tame man, go! Hang off, thou cat, thou burr! vile thing, let loose, Or I will shake thee from me like a serpent. Why are you grown so rude? what change is this, Sweet love,â€” Thy love! out, tawny Tartar, out! Out, loathed medicine! hated poison, hence! Do you not jest? Yes, sooth; and so do you. Demetrius, I will keep my word with thee. I would I had your bond, for I perceive A weak bond holds you: I'll not trust your word. What! should I hurt her, strike her, kill her dead? Although I hate her, I'll not harm her so. What! can you do me greater harm than hate? Hate me! wherefore? O me! what news, my love? Am not I Hermia? Are not you Lysander? I am as fair now as I was erewhile. Since night you lov'd me; yet, since night you left me: Why, then you left me,â€”O, the gods forbid!â€” In earnest, shall I say? Ay, by my life; And never did desire to see thee more. Therefore be out of hope, of question, doubt; Be certain, nothing truer: 'tis no jest, That I do hate thee and love Helena. O me! you juggler! you canker-blossom! You thief of love! what! have you come by night And stol'n my love's heart from him? Fine, i' faith! Have you no modesty, no maiden shame, No touch of bashfulness? What! will you tear Impatient answers from my gentle tongue? Fie, fie! you counterfeit, you puppet you! Puppet! why, so: ay, that way goes the game. Now I perceive that she hath made compare Between our statures: she hath urg'd her height; And with her personage, her tall personage, Her height, forsooth, she hath prevail'd with him. And are you grown so high in his esteem, Because I am so dwarfish and so low? How low am I, thou painted maypole? speak; How low am I? I am not yet so low But that my nails can reach unto thine eyes. I pray you, though you mock me, gentlemen, Let her not hurt me: I was never curst; I have no gift at all in shrewishness; I am a right maid for my cowardice: Let her not strike me. You perhaps may think, Because she is something lower than myself, That I can match her. Lower! hark, again. Good Hermia, do not be so bitter with me. I evermore did love you, Hermia, Did ever keep your counsels, never wrong'd you; Save that, in love unto Demetrius, I told him of your stealth unto this wood. He follow'd you; for love I follow'd him; But he hath chid me hence, and threaten'd me To strike me, spurn me, nay, to kill me too: And now, so you will let me quiet go, To Athens will I bear my folly back, And follow you no further: let me go: You see how simple and how fond I am. Why, get you gone. Who is't that hinders you? A foolish heart, that I leave here behind. What! with Lysander? With Demetrius. Be not afraid: she shall not harm thee, Helena. No, sir; she shall not, though you take her part. O! when she's angry, she is keen and shrewd. She was a vixen when she went to school: And though she be but little, she is fierce. 'Little' again! nothing but 'low' and 'little!' Why will you suffer her to flout me thus? Let me come to her. Get you gone, you dwarf; You minimus, of hindering knot-grass made; You bead, you acorn! You are too officious In her behalf that scorns your services. Let her alone; speak not of Helena; Take not her part, for, if thou dost intend Never so little show of love to her, Thou shalt aby it. Now she holds me not; Now follow, if thou dar'st, to try whose right, Or thine or mine, is most in Helena. Follow! nay, I'll go with thee, cheek by jole. You, mistress, all this coil is 'long of you: Nay, go not back. I will not trust you, I, Nor longer stay in your curst company. Your hands than mine are quicker for a fray, My legs are longer though, to run away. I am amaz'd, and know not what to say. This is thy negligence: still thou mistak'st, Or else commit'st thy knaveries wilfully. Believe me, king of shadows, I mistook. Did not you tell me I should know the man By the Athenian garments he had on? And so far blameless proves my enterprise, That I have 'nointed an Athenian's eyes; And so far am I glad it so did sort, As this their jangling I esteem a sport. Thou see'st these lovers seek a place to fight: Hie therefore, Robin, overcast the night; The starry welking cover thou anon With drooping fog as black as Acheron; And lead these testy rivals so astray, As one come not within another's way. Like to Lysander sometime frame thy tongue, Then stir Demetrius up with bitter wrong; And sometime rail thou like Demetrius; And from each other look thou lead them thus, Till o'er their brows death-counterfeiting sleep With leaden legs and batty wings doth creep: Then crush this herb into Lysander's eye; Whose liquor hath this virtuous property, To take from thence all error with his might, And make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight. When they next wake, all this derision Shall seem a dream and fruitless vision; And back to Athens shall the lovers wend, With league whose date till death shall never end. Whiles I in this affair do thee employ, I'll to my queen and beg her Indian boy; And then I will her charmed eye release From monster's view, and all things shall be peace. My fairy lord, this must be done with haste, For night's swift dragons cut the clouds full fast, And yonder shines Aurora's harbinger; At whose approach, ghosts, wandering here and there, Troop home to churchyards: damned spirits all, That in cross-ways and floods have burial, Already to their wormy beds are gone; For fear lest day should look their shames upon, They wilfully themselves exile from light, And must for aye consort with black-brow'd night. But we are spirits of another sort. I with the morning's love have oft made sport; And, like a forester, the groves may tread, Even till the eastern gate, all fiery-red, Opening on Neptune with fair blessed beams, Turns into yellow gold his salt green-streams. But, notwithstanding, haste; make no delay: We may effect this business yet ere day. Up and down, up and down; I will lead them up and down: I am fear'd in field and town; Goblin, lead them up and down. Here comes one. Where art thou, proud Demetrius? speak thou now. Here, villain! drawn and ready. Where art thou? I will be with thee straight. Follow me, then, To plainer ground. Lysander! speak again. Thou runaway, thou coward, art thou fled? Speak! In some bush? Where dost thou hide thy head? Thou coward! art thou bragging to the stars, Telling the bushes that thou look'st for wars, And wilt not come? Come, recreant; come, thou child; I'll whip thee with a rod: he is defil'd That draws a sword on thee. Yea, art thou there? Follow my voice: we'll try no manhood here. He goes before me and still dares me on: When I come where he calls, then he is gone. The villain is much lighter-heel'd than I: I follow'd fast, but faster he did fly; That fallen am I in dark uneven way, And here will rest me. Come, thou gentle day! For if but once thou show me thy grey light, I'll find Demetrius and revenge this spite. Ho! ho! ho! Coward, why com'st thou not? Abide me, if thou dar'st; for well I wot Thou runn'st before me, shifting every place, And dar'st not stand, nor look me in the face. Where art thou now? Come hither: I am here. Nay then, thou mock'st me. Thou shalt buy this dear, If ever I thy face by daylight see: Now, go thy way. Faintness constraineth me To measure out my length on this cold bed: By day's approach look to be visited. O weary night! O long and tedious night, Abate thy hours! shine, comforts, from the east! That I may back to Athens by daylight, From these that my poor company detest: And sleep, that sometimes shuts up sorrow's eye, Steal me awhile from mine own company. Yet but three? Come one more; Two of both kinds make up four. Here she comes, curst and sad: Cupid is a knavish lad, Thus to make poor females mad. Never so weary, never so in woe, Bedabbled with the dew and torn with briers, I can no further crawl, no further go; My legs can keep no pace with my desires. Here will I rest me till the break of day. Heavens shield Lysander, if they mean a fray! On the ground Sleep sound: I'll apply To your eye, Gentle lover, remedy When thou wak'st, Thou tak'st True delight In the sight Of thy former lady's eye: And the country proverb known, That every man should take his own, In your waking shall be shown: Jack shall have Jill; Nought shall go ill; The man shall have his mare again, And all shall be well. Come, sit thee down upon this flowery bed, While I thy amiable cheeks do coy, And stick musk-roses in thy sleek smooth head, And kiss thy fair large ears, my gentle joy. Where's Pease-blossom? Ready. Scratch my head, Pease-blossom. Where's Mounsieur Cobweb? Ready. Mounsieur Cobweb, good mounsieur, get your weapons in your hand, and kill me a red-hipped humble-bee on the top of a thistle; and, good mounsieur, bring me the honey-bag. Do not fret yourself too much in the action, mounsieur; and, good mounsieur, have a care the honey-bag break not; I would be loath to have you overflown with a honey-bag, signior. Where's Mounsieur Mustard-seed? Ready. Give me your neaf, Mounsieur Mustard-seed. Pray you, leave your curtsy, good mounsieur. What's your will? Nothing, good mounsieur, but to help Cavalery Cobweb to scratch. I must to the barber's, mounsieur, for methinks I am marvellous hairy about the face; and I am such a tender ass, if my hair do but tickle me, I must scratch. What, wilt thou hear some music, my sweet love? I have a reasonable good ear in music: let us have the tongs and the bones. Or say, sweet love, what thou desir'st to eat. Truly, a peck of provender: I could munch your good dry oats. Methinks I have a great desire to a bottle of hay: good hay, sweet hay, hath no fellow. I have a venturous fairy that shall seek The squirrel's hoard, and fetch thee thence new nuts. I had rather have a handful or two of dried pease. But, I pray you, let none of your people stir me: I have an exposition of sleep come upon me. Sleep thou, and I will wind thee in my arms. Fairies, be gone, and be all ways away. So doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle Gently entwist; the female ivy so Enrings the barky fingers of the elm. O! how I love thee; how I dote on thee! Welcome, good Robin. See'st thou this sweet sight? Her dotage now I do begin to pity: For, meeting her of late behind the wood, Seeking sweet favours for this hateful fool, I did upbraid her and fall out with her; For she his hairy temples then had rounded With coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers; And that same dew, which sometime on the buds Was wont to swell like round and orient pearls, Stood now within the pretty flowerets' eyes Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail. When I had at my pleasure taunted her, And she in mild terms begg'd my patience, I then did ask of her her changeling child; Which straight she gave me, and her fairy sent To bear him to my bower in fairy land. And now I have the boy, I will undo This hateful imperfection of her eyes: And, gentle Puck, take this transformed scalp From off the head of this Athenian swain, That he, awaking when the other do, May all to Athens back again repair, And think no more of this night's accidents But as the fierce vexation of a dream. But first I will release the fairy queen. Be as thou wast wont to be; See as thou wast wont to see: Dian's bud o'er Cupid's flower Hath such force and blessed power. Now, my Titania; wake you, my sweet queen. My Oberon! what visions have I seen! Methought I was enamour'd of an ass. There lies your love. How came these things to pass? O! how mine eyes do loathe his visage now. Silence, awhile. Robin, take off this head. Titania, music call; and strike more dead Than common sleep of all these five the sense. Music, ho! music! such as charmeth sleep. When thou wak'st, with thine own fool's eyes peep. Sound, music! Come, my queen, take hands with me, And rock the ground whereon these sleepers be. Now thou and I are new in amity, And will to-morrow midnight solemnly Dance in Duke Theseus' house triumphantly, And bless it to all fair prosperity. There shall the pairs of faithful lovers be Wedded, with Theseus, all in jollity. Fairy king, attend, and mark: I do hear the morning lark. Then, my queen, in silence sad, Trip we after the night's shade; We the globe can compass soon, Swifter than the wandering moon. Come, my lord; and in our flight Tell me how it came this night That I sleeping here was found With these mortals on the ground. Go, one of you, find out the forester; For now our observation is perform'd; And since we have the vaward of the day, My love shall hear the music of my hounds. Uncouple in the western valley; let them go: Dispatch, I say, and find the forester. We will, fair queen, up to the mountain's top, And mark the musical confusion Of hounds and echo in conjunction. I was with Hercules and Cadmus once, When in a wood of Crete they bay'd the bear With hounds of Sparta: never did I hear Such gallant chiding; for, besides the groves, The skies, the fountains, every region near Seem'd all one mutual cry. I never heard So musical a discord, such sweet thunder. My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind, So flew'd, so sanded; and their heads are hung With ears that sweep away the morning dew; Crook-knee'd, and dew-lapp'd like Thessalian bulls; Slow in pursuit, but match'd in mouth like bells, Each under each. A cry more tuneable Was never holla'd to, nor cheer'd with horn, In Crete, in Sparta, nor in Thessaly: Judge, when you hear. But, soft! what nymphs are these? My lord, this is my daughter here asleep; And this, Lysander; this Demetrius is; This Helena, old Nedar's Helena: I wonder of their being here together. No doubt they rose up early to observe The rite of May, and, hearing our intent, Came here in grace of our solemnity. But speak, Egeus, is not this the day That Hermia should give answer of her choice? It is, my lord. Go, bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns. Good morrow, friends. Saint Valentine is past: Begin these wood-birds but to couple now? Pardon, my lord. I pray you all, stand up. I know you two are rival enemies: How comes this gentle concord in the world, That hatred is so far from jealousy, To sleep by hate, and fear no enmity? My lord, I shall reply amazedly, Half sleep, half waking: but as yet, I swear, I cannot truly say how I came here; But, as I think,â€”for truly would I speak, And now I do bethink me, so it is,â€” I came with Hermia hither: our intent Was to be gone from Athens, where we might, Without the peril of the Athenian lawâ€” Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough: I beg the law, the law, upon his head. They would have stol'n away; they would, Demetrius, Thereby to have defeated you and me; You of your wife, and me of my consent, Of my consent that she should be your wife. My lord, fair Helen told me of their stealth, Of this their purpose hither, to this wood; And I in fury hither follow'd them, Fair Helena in fancy following me. But, my good lord, I wot not by what power,â€” But by some power it is,â€”my love to Hermia, Melted as doth the snow, seems to me now As the remembrance of an idle gaud Which in my childhood I did dote upon; And all the faith, the virtue of my heart, The object and the pleasure of mine eye, Is only Helena. To her, my lord, Was I betroth'd ere I saw Hermia: But, like in sickness, did I loathe this food; But, as in health, come to my natural taste, Now do I wish it, love it, long for it, And will for evermore be true to it. Fair lovers, you are fortunately met: Of this discourse we more will hear anon. Egeus, I will overbear your will, For in the temple, by and by, with us, These couples shall eternally be knit: And, for the morning now is something worn, Our purpos'd hunting shall be set aside. Away with us, to Athens: three and three, We'll hold a feast in great solemnity. Come, Hippolyta. These things seem small and undistinguishable, Like far-off mountains turned into clouds. Methinks I see these things with parted eye, When everything seems double. So methinks: And I have found Demetrius, like a jewel, Mine own, and not mine own. Are you sure That we are awake? It seems to me That yet we sleep, we dream. Do you not think The duke was here, and bid us follow him? Yea; and my father. And Hippolyta. And he did bid us follow to the temple. Why then, we are awake. Let's follow him; And by the way let us recount our dreams. When my cue comes, call me, and I will answer: my next is, 'Most fair Pyramus.' Heigh-ho! Peter Quince! Flute, the bellows-mender! Snout, the tinker! Starveling! God's my life! stolen hence, and left me asleep! I have had a most rare vision. I have had a dream, past the wit of man to say what dream it was: man is but an ass, if he go about to expound this dream. Methought I wasâ€”there is no man can tell what. Methought I was,â€”and methought I had,â€”but man is but a patched fool, if he will offer to say what methought I had. The eye of man hath not heard, the ear of man hath not seen, man's hand is not able to taste, his tongue to conceive, nor his heart to report, what my dream was. I will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of this dream: it shall be called Bottom's Dream, because it hath no bottom; and I will sing it in the latter end of a play, before the duke: peradventure, to make it the more gracious, I shall sing it at her death. Have you sent to Bottom's house? is he come home yet? He cannot be heard of. Out of doubt he is transported. If he come not, then the play is marred: it goes not forward, doth it? It is not possible: you have not a man in all Athens able to discharge Pyramus but he. No; he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft man in Athens. Yea, and the best person too; and he is a very paramour for a sweet voice. You must say, 'paragon:' a paramour is, God bless us! a thing of naught. Masters, the duke is coming from the temple, and there is two or three lords and ladies more married: if our sport had gone forward, we had all been made men. O sweet bully Bottom! Thus hath he lost sixpence a day during his life; he could not have 'scaped sixpence a day: an the duke had not given him sixpence a day for playing Pyramus, I'll be hanged; he would have deserved it: sixpence a day in Pyramus, or nothing. Where are these lads? where are these hearts? Bottom! O most courageous day! O most happy hour! Masters, I am to discourse wonders: but ask me not what; for if I tell you, I am no true Athenian. I will tell you everything, right as it fell out. Let us hear, sweet Bottom. Not a word of me. All that I will tell you is, that the duke hath dined. Get your apparel together, good strings to your beards, new ribbons to your pumps; meet presently at the palace; every man look o'er his part; for the short and the long is, our play is preferred. In any case, let Thisby have clean linen; and let not him that plays the lion pare his nails, for they shall hang out for the lion's claws. And, most dear actors, eat no onions nor garlic, for we are to utter sweet breath, and I do not doubt but to hear them say, it is a sweet comedy. No more words: away! go; away. 'Tis strange, my Theseus, that these lovers speak of. More strange than true. I never may believe These antique fables, nor these fairy toys. Lovers and madmen have such seething brains, Such shaping fantasies, that apprehend More than cool reason ever comprehends. The lunatic, the lover, and the poet, Are of imagination all compact: One sees more devils than vast hell can hold, That is, the madman; the lover, all as frantic, Sees Helen's beauty in a brow of Egypt: The poet's eye, in a fine frenzy rolling, Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven; And, as imagination bodies forth The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen Turns them to shapes, and gives to airy nothing A local habitation and a name. Such tricks hath strong imagination, That, if it would but apprehend some joy, It comprehends some bringer of that joy; Or in the night, imagining some fear, How easy is a bush suppos'd a bear! But all the story of the night told over, And all their minds transfigur'd so together, More witnesseth than fancy's images, And grows to something of great constancy, But, howsoever, strange and admirable. Here come the lovers, full of joy and mirth. Joy, gentle friends! joy, and fresh days of love Accompany your hearts! More than to us Wait in your royal walks, your board, your bed! Come now; what masques, what dances shall we have, To wear away this long age of three hours Between our after-supper and bed-time? Where is our usual manager of mirth? What revels are in hand? Is there no play, To ease the anguish of a torturing hour? Call Philostrate. Here, mighty Theseus. Say, what abridgment have you for this evening? What masque? what music? How shall we beguile The lazy time, if not with some delight? There is a brief how many sports are ripe; Make choice of which your highness will see first. The battle with the Centaurs, to be sung By an Athenian eunuch to the harp. We'll none of that: that have I told my love, In glory of my kinsman Hercules. The riot of the tipsy Bacchanals, Tearing the Thracian singer in their rage. That is an old device; and it was play'd When I from Thebes came last a conqueror. The thrice three Muses mourning for the death Of Learning, late deceas'd in beggary. That is some satire keen and critical, Not sorting with a nuptial ceremony. A tedious brief scene of young Pyramus And his love Thisbe; very tragical mirth. Merry and tragical! tedious and brief! That is, hot ice and wonderous strange snow. How shall we find the concord of this discord? A play there is, my lord, some ten words long, Which is as brief as I have known a play; But by ten words, my lord, it is too long, Which makes it tedious; for in all the play There is not one word apt, one player fitted. And tragical, my noble lord, it is; For Pyramus therein doth kill himself. Which when I saw rehears'd, I must confess, Made mine eyes water; but more merry tears The passion of loud laughter never shed. What are they that do play it? Hard-handed men, that work in Athens here, Which never labour'd in their minds till now, And now have toil'd their unbreath'd memories With this same play, against your nuptial. And we will hear it. No, my noble lord; It is not for you: I have heard it over, And it is nothing, nothing in the world; Unless you can find sport in their intents, Extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain, To do you service. I will hear that play; For never anything can be amiss, When simpleness and duty tender it. Go, bring them in: and take your places, ladies. I love not to see wretchedness o'ercharg'd, And duty in his service perishing. Why, gentle sweet, you shall see no such thing. He says they can do nothing in this kind. The kinder we, to give them thanks for nothing. Our sport shall be to take what they mistake: And what poor duty cannot do, noble respect Takes it in might, not merit. Where I have come, great clerks have purposed To greet me with premeditated welcomes; Where I have seen them shiver and look pale, Make periods in the midst of sentences, Throttle their practis'd accent in their fears, And, in conclusion, dumbly have broke off, Not paying me a welcome. Trust me, sweet, Out of this silence yet I pick'd a welcome; And in the modesty of fearful duty I read as much as from the rattling tongue Of saucy and audacious eloquence. Love, therefore, and tongue-tied simplicity In least speak most, to my capacity. So please your Grace, the Prologue is address'd. Let him approach. If we offend, it is with our good will. That you should think, we come not to offend, But with good will. To show our simple skill, That is the true beginning of our end. Consider then we come but in despite. We do not come as minding to content you, Our true intent is. All for your delight, We are not here. That you should here repent you, The actors are at hand; and, by their show, You shall know all that you are like to know. This fellow doth not stand upon points. He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt; he knows not the stop. A good moral, my lord: it is not enough to speak, but to speak true. Indeed he hath played on his prologue like a child on a recorder; a sound, but not in government. His speech was like a tangled chain; nothing impaired, but all disordered. Who is next? Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show; But wonder on, till truth make all things plain. This man is Pyramus, if you would know; This beauteous lady Thisby is, certain. This man, with lime and rough-cast, doth present Wall, that vile Wall which did these lovers sunder; And through Wall's chink, poor souls, they are content To whisper, at the which let no man wonder. This man, with lanthorn, dog, and bush of thorn, Presenteth Moonshine; for, if you will know, By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn To meet at Ninus' tomb, there, there to woo. This grisly beast, which Lion hight by name, The trusty Thisby, coming first by night, Did scare away, or rather did affright; And, as she fied, her mantle she did fall, Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain. Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youth and tall, And finds his trusty Thisby's mantle slain: Whereat, with blade, with bloody blameful blade, He bravely broach'd his boiling bloody breast; And Thisby, tarrying in mulberry shade, His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest, Let Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain, At large discourse, while here they do remain. I wonder, if the lion be to speak. No wonder, my lord: one lion may, when many asses do. Wall. In this same interlude it doth befall That I, one Snout by name, present a wall; And such a wall, as I would have you think, That had in it a crannied hole or chink, Through which the lovers, Pyramus and Thisby, Did whisper often very secretly. This loam, this rough-cast, and this stone doth show That I am that same wall; the truth is so; And this the cranny is, right and sinister, Through which the fearful lovers are to whisper. Would you desire lime and hair to speak better? It is the wittiest partition that ever I heard discourse, my lord. Pyramus draws near the wall: silence! O grim-look'd night! O night with hue so black! O night, which ever art when day is not! O night! O night! alack, alack, alack! I fear my Thisby's promise is forgot. And thou, O wall! O sweet, O lovely wall! That stand'st between her father's ground and mine; Thou wall, O wall! O sweet, and lovely wall! Show me thy chink to blink through with mine eyne. Thanks, courteous wall: Jove shield thee well for this! But what see I? No Thisby do I see. O wicked wall! through whom I see no bliss; Curs'd be thy stones for thus deceiving me! The wall, methinks, being sensible, should curse again. No, in truth, sir, he should not. 'Deceiving me,' is Thisby's cue: she is to enter now, and I am to spy her through the wall. You shall see, it will fall pat as I told you. Yonder she comes. O wall! full often hast thou heard my moans, For parting my fair Pyramus and me: My cherry lips have often kiss'd thy stones, Thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee. I see a voice: now will I to the chink, To spy an I can hear my Thisby's face. Thisby. My love! thou art my love, I think. Think what thou wilt, I am thy lover's grace; And, like Limander, am I trusty still. And I like Helen, till the Fates me kill. Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true. As Shafalus to Procrus, I to you. O! kiss me through the hole of this vile wall. I kiss the wall's hole, not your lips at all Wilt thou at Ninny's tomb meet me straightway? 'Tide life, 'tide death, I come without delay. Thus have I, Wall, my part discharged so; And, being done, thus Wall away doth go. Now is the mural down between the two neighbours. No remedy, my lord, when walls are so wilful to hear without warning. This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard. The best in this kind are but shadows, and the worst are no worse, if imagination amend them. It must be your imagination then, and not theirs. If we imagine no worse of them than they of themselves, they may pass for excellent men. Here come two noble beasts in, a man and a lion. You, ladies, you, whose gentle hearts do fear The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor, May now perchance both quake and tremble here, When lion rough in wildest rage doth roar. Then know that I, one Snug the joiner, am A lion-fell, nor else no lion's dam: For, if I should as lion come in strife Into this place, 'twere pity on my life. A very gentle beast, and of a good conscience. The very best at a beast, my lord, that e'er I saw. This lion is a very fox for his valour. True; and a goose for his discretion. Not so, my lord; for his valour cannot carry his discretion, and the fox carries the goose. His discretion, I am sure, cannot carry his valour, for the goose carries not the fox. It is well: leave it to his discretion, and let us listen to the moon. This lanthorn doth the horned moon present;â€” He should have worn the horns on his head. He is no crescent, and his horns are invisible within the circumference. This lanthorn doth the horned moon present; Myself the man i' the moon do seem to be. This is the greatest error of all the rest. The man should be put into the lanthorn: how is it else the man i' the moon? He dares not come there for the candle; for, you see, it is already in snuff. I am aweary of this moon: would he would change! It appears, by his small light of discretion, that he is in the wane; but yet, in courtesy, in all reason, we must stay the time. Proceed, Moon. All that I have to say, is, to tell you that the lanthorn is the moon; I, the man in the moon; this thorn-bush, my thorn-bush; and this dog, my dog. Why, all these should be in the lanthorn; for all these are in the moon. But, silence! here comes Thisbe. This is old Ninny's tomb. Where is my love? Ohâ€”. Well roared, Lion. Well run, Thisbe. Well shone, Moon. Truly, the moon shines with a good grace. Well moused, Lion. And then came Pyramus. And so the lion vanished. Sweet moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams; I thank thee, moon, for shining now so bright, For, by thy gracious, golden, glittering streams, I trust to taste of truest Thisby's sight. But stay, O spite! But mark, poor knight, What dreadful dole is here! Eyes, do you see? How can it be? O dainty duck! O dear! Thy mantle good, What! stain'd with blood! Approach, ye Furies fell! O Fates, come, come, Cut thread and thrum; Quail, crush, conclude, and quell! This passion, and the death of a dear friend, would go near to make a man look sad. Beshrew my heart, but I pity the man. O! wherefore, Nature, didst thou lions frame? Since lion vile hath here deflower'd my dear? Which isâ€”no, noâ€”which was the fairest dame That liv'd, that lov'd, that lik'd, that look'd with cheer. Come tears, confound; Out, sword, and wound The pap of Pyramus: Ay, that left pap, Where heart doth hop: Thus die I, thus, thus, thus. Now am I dead, Now am I fled; My soul is in the sky: Tongue, lose thy light! Moon, take thy flight! Now die, die, die, die, die. No die, but an ace, for him; for he is but one. Less than an ace, man, for he is dead; he is nothing. With the help of a surgeon, he might yet recover, and prove an ass. How chance Moonshine is gone before Thisbe comes back and finds her lover? She will find him by starlight. Here she comes; and her passion ends the play. Methinks she should not use a long one for such a Pyramus: I hope she will be brief. A mote will turn the balance, which Pyramus, which Thisbe, is the better: he for a man, God warrant us; she for a woman, God bless us. She hath spied him already with those sweet eyes. And thus she moans, videlicet:â€” Asleep, my love? What, dead, my dove? O Pyramus, arise! Speak, speak! Quite dumb? Dead, dead! A tomb Must cover thy sweet eyes. These lily lips, This cherry nose, These yellow cowslip cheeks, Are gone, are gone: Lovers, make moan! His eyes were green as leeks. O, Sisters Three, Come, come to me, With hands as pale as milk; Lay them in gore, Since you have shore With shears his thread of silk. Tongue, not a word: Come, trusty sword: Come, blade, my breast imbrue: And farewell, friends; Thus Thisby ends: Adieu, adieu, adieu. Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead. Ay, and Wall too. No, I assure you; the wall is down that parted their fathers. Will it please you to see the epilogue, or to hear a Bergomask dance between two of our company? No epilogue, I pray you; for your play needs no excuse. Never excuse; for when the players are all dead, there need none to be blamed. Marry, if he that writ it had played Pyramus, and hanged himself in Thisbe's garter, it would have been a fine tragedy: and so it is, truly, and very notably discharged. But come, your Bergomask: let your epilogue alone. The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve; Lovers, to bed; 'tis almost fairy time. I fear we shall out-sleep the coming morn, As much as we this night have overwatch'd. This palpable-gross play hath well beguil'd The heavy gait of night. Sweet friends, to bed. A fortnight hold we this solemnity, In nightly revels, and new jollity. Now the hungry lion roars, And the wolf behowls the moon; Whilst the heavy ploughman snores, All with weary task fordone. Now the wasted brands do glow, Whilst the screech-owl, screeching loud, Puts the wretch that lies in woe In remembrance of a shroud. Now it is the time of night That the graves, all gaping wide, Every one lets forth his sprite, In the church-way paths to glide: And we fairies, that do run By the triple Hecate's team, From the presence of the sun, Following darkness like a dream, Now are frolic; not a mouse Shall disturb this hallow'd house: I am sent with broom before, To sweep the dust behind the door. Through the house give glimmering light By the dead and drowsy fire; Every elf and fairy sprite Hop as light as bird from brier; And this ditty after me Sing and dance it trippingly. First, rehearse your song by rote, To each word a warbling note: Hand in hand, with fairy grace, Will we sing, and bless this place. Now, until the break of day, Through this house each fairy stray. To the best bride-bed will we, Which by us shall blessed be; And the issue there create Ever shall be fortunate. So shall all the couples three Ever true in loving be; And the blots of Nature's hand Shall not in their issue stand: Never mole, hare-lip, nor scar, Nor mark prodigious, such as are Despised in nativity, Shall upon their children be. With this field-dew consecrate, Every fairy take his gait, And each several chamber bless, Through this palace, with sweet peace; Ever shall in safety rest, And the owner of it blest. Trip away; Make no stay; Meet me all by break of day. If we shadows have offended, Think but this, and all is mended, That you have but slumber'd here While these visions did appear. And this weak and idle theme, No more yielding but a dream, Gentles, do not reprehend: If you pardon, we will mend. And, as I'm an honest Puck, If we have unearned luck Now to 'scape the serpent's tongue, We will make amends ere long; Else the Puck a liar call: So, good night unto you all. Give me your hands, if we be friends, And Robin shall restore amends.\n"

      "If music be the food of love, play on; Give me excess of it, that, surfeiting, The appetite may sicken, and so die. That strain again! it had a dying fall: O! it came o'er my ear like the sweet sound That breathes upon a bank of violets, Stealing and giving odour. Enough! no more: 'Tis not so sweet now as it was before. O spirit of love! how quick and fresh art thou, That, notwithstanding thy capacity Receiveth as the sea, nought enters there, Of what validity and pitch soe'er, But falls into abatement and low price, Even in a minute: so full of shapes is fancy, That it alone is high fantastical. Will you go hunt, my lord? What, Curio? The hart. Why, so I do, the noblest that I have. O! when mine eyes did see Olivia first, Methought she purg'd the air of pestilence. That instant was I turn'd into a hart, And my desires, like fell and cruel hounds, E'er since pursue me. How now! what news from her? So please my lord, I might not be admitted; But from her handmaid do return this answer: The element itself, till seven years' heat, Shall not behold her face at ample view; But, like a cloistress, she will veiled walk, And water once a day her chamber round With eve-offending brine: all this, to season A brother's dead love, which she would keep fresh And lasting in her sad remembrance. O! she that hath a heart of that fine frame To pay this debt of love but to a brother, How will she love, when the rich golden shaft Hath kill'd the flock of all affections else That live in her; when liver, brain, and heart, These sovereign thrones, are all supplied, and fill'd Her sweet perfections with one self king. Away before me to sweet beds of flowers; Love-thoughts lie rich when canopied with bowers. What country, friends, is this? This is Illyria, lady. And what should I do in Illyria? My brother he is in Elysium. Perchance he is not drown'd: what think you sailors? It is perchance that you yourself were sav'd. O my poor brother! and so perchance may he be. True, madam: and, to comfort you with chance, Assure yourself, after our ship did split, When you and those poor number sav'd with you Hung on our driving boat, I saw your brother, Most provident in peril, bind himself,â€” Courage and hope both teaching him the practice,â€” To a strong mast that liv'd upon the sea; Where, like Arion on the dolphin's back, I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves So long as I could see. For saying so there's gold. Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope, Whereto thy speech serves for authority, The like of him. Know'st thou this country? Ay, madam, well; for I was bred and born Not three hours' travel from this very place. Who governs here? A noble duke, in nature as in name. What is his name? Orsino. Orsino! I have heard my father name him: He was a bachelor then. And so is now, or was so very late; For but a month ago I went from hence, And then 'twas fresh in murmur,â€”as, you know, What great ones do the less will prattle of,â€” That he did seek the love of fair Olivia. What's she? A virtuous maid, the daughter of a count That died some twelvemonth since; then leaving her In the protection of his son, her brother, Who shortly also died: for whose dear love, They say she hath abjur'd the company And sight of men. O! that I serv'd that lady, And might not be deliver'd to the world, Till I had made mine own occasion mellow, What my estate is. That were hard to compass, Because she will admit no kind of suit, No, not the duke's. There is a fair behaviour in thee, captain; And though that nature with a beauteous wall Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee I will believe thou hast a mind that suits With this thy fair and outward character. I prithee,â€”and I'll pay thee bounteously,â€” Conceal me what I am, and be my aid For such disguise as haply shall become The form of my intent. I'll serve this duke: Thou shalt present me as a eunuch to him: It may be worth thy pains; for I can sing And speak to him in many sorts of music That will allow me very worth his service. What else may hap to time I will commit; Only shape thou thy silence to my wit. Be you his eunuch, and your mute I'll be: When my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see. I thank thee: lead me on. What a plague means my niece, to take the death of her brother thus? I am sure care's an enemy to life. By my troth, Sir Toby, you must come in earlier o' nights: your cousin, my lady, takes great exceptions to your ill hours. Why, let her except before excepted. Ay, but you must confine yourself within the modest limits of order. Confine! I'll confine myself no finer than I am. These clothes are good enough to drink in, and so be these boots too: an they be not, let them hang themselves in their own straps. That quaffing and drinking will undo you: I heard my lady talk of it yesterday; and of a foolish knight that you brought in one night here to be her wooer. Who? Sir Andrew Aguecheek? Ay, he. He's as tall a man as any's in Illyria. What's that to the purpose? Why, he has three thousand ducats a year. Ay, but he'll have but a year in all these ducats: he's a very fool and a prodigal. Fie, that you'll say so! he plays o' the viol-de-gamboys, and speaks three or four languages word for word without book, and hath all the good gifts of nature. He hath indeed, almost natural; for, besides that he's a fool, he's a great quarreller; and but that he hath the gift of a coward to allay the gust he hath in quarrelling, 'tis thought among the prudent he would quickly have the gift of a grave. By this hand, they are scoundrels and substractors that say so of him. Who are they? They that add, moreover, he's drunk nightly in your company. With drinking healths to my niece. I'll drink to her as long as there is a passage in my throat and drink in Illyria. He's a coward and a coystril, that will not drink to my niece till his brains turn o' the toe like a parish-top. What, wench! Castiliano vulgo! for here comes Sir Andrew Agueface. Sir Toby Belch! how now, Sir Toby Belch! Sweet Sir Andrew! Bless you, fair shrew. And you too, sir. Accost, Sir Andrew, accost. What's that? My niece's chambermaid. Good Mistress Accost, I desire better acquaintance. My name is Mary, sir. Good Mistress Mary Accost,â€” You mistake, knight: 'accost' is, front her, board her, woo her, assail her. By my troth, I would not undertake her in this company. Is that the meaning of 'accost?' Fare you well, gentlemen. An thou let her part so, Sir Andrew, would thou mightst never draw sword again! An you part so, mistress, I would I might never draw sword again. Fair lady, do you think you have fools in hand? Sir, I have not you by the hand. Marry, but you shall have; and here's my hand. Now, sir, 'thought is free:' I pray you, bring your hand to the buttery-bar and let it drink. Wherefore, sweetheart? what's your metaphor? It's dry, sir. Why, I think so: I am not such an ass but I can keep my hand dry. But what's your jest? A dry jest, sir. Are you full of them? Ay, sir, I have them at my fingers' ends: marry, now I let go your hand, I am barren. O knight! thou lackest a cup of canary: when did I see thee so put down? Never in your life, I think; unless you see canary put me down. Methinks sometimes I have no more wit than a Christian or an ordinary man has; but I am a great eater of beef, and I believe that does harm to my wit. No question. An I thought that, I'd forswear it. I'll ride home to-morrow, Sir Toby. Pourquoi, my dear knight? What is 'pourquoi?' do or not do? I would I had bestowed that time in the tongues that I have in fencing, dancing, and bear-baiting. O! had I but followed the arts! Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair. Why, would that have mended my hair? Past question; for thou seest it will not curl by nature. But it becomes me well enough, does't not? Excellent; it hangs like flax on a distaff, and I hope to see a housewife take thee between her legs, and spin it off. Faith, I'll home to-morrow, Sir Toby: your niece will not be seen; or if she be, it's four to one she'll none of me. The count himself here hard by woos her. She'll none o' the count; she'll not match above her degree, neither in estate, years, nor wit; I have heard her swear it. Tut, there's life in't, man. I'll stay a month longer. I am a fellow o' the strangest mind i' the world; I delight in masques and revels sometimes altogether. Art thou good at these kickchawses, knight? As any man in Illyria, whatsoever he be, under the degree of my betters: and yet I will not compare with an old man. What is thy excellence in a galliard, knight? Faith, I can cut a caper. And I can cut the mutton to't. And I think I have the back-trick simply as strong as any man in Illyria. Wherefore are these things hid? wherefore have these gifts a curtain before 'em? are they like to take dust, like Mistress Mall's picture? why dost thou not go to church in a galliard, and come home in a coranto? My very walk should be a jig: I would not so much as make water but in a sink-a-pace. What dost thou mean? is it a world to hide virtues in? I did think, by the excellent constitution of thy leg, it was formed under the star of a galliard. Ay, 'tis strong, and it does indifferent well in a flame-coloured stock. Shall we set about some revels? What shall we do else? were we not born under Taurus? Taurus! that's sides and heart. No, sir, it is legs and thighs. Let me see thee caper. Ha! higher: ha, ha! excellent! If the duke continue these favours towards you, Cesario, you are like to be much advanced: he hath known you but three days, and already you are no stranger. You either fear his humour or my negligence, that you call in question the continuance of his love. Is he inconstant, sir, in his favours? No, believe me. I thank you. Here comes the count. Who saw Cesario? ho! On your attendance, my lord; here. Stand you awhile aloof. Cesario, Thou know'st no less but all; I have unclasp'd To thee the book even of my secret soul: Therefore, good youth, address thy gait unto her, Be not denied access, stand at her doors, And tell them, there thy fixed foot shall grow Till thou have audience. Sure, my noble lord, If she be so abandon'd to her sorrow As it is spoke, she never will admit me. Be clamorous and leap all civil bounds Rather than make unprofited return. Say I do speak with her, my lord, what then? O! then unfold the passion of my love; Surprise her with discourse of my dear faith: It shall become thee well to act my woes; She will attend it better in thy youth Than in a nuncio of more grave aspect. I think not so, my lord. Dear lad, believe it; For they shall yet belie thy happy years That say thou art a man: Diana's lip Is not more smooth and rubious; thy small pipe Is as the maiden's organ, shrill and sound; And all is semblative a woman's part. I know thy constellation is right apt For this affair. Some four or five attend him; All, if you will; for I myself am best When least in company. Prosper well in this, And thou shalt live as freely as thy lord, To call his fortunes thine. I'll do my best To woo your lady: yet, a barful strife! Whoe'er I woo, myself would be his wife. Nay, either tell me where thou hast been, or I will not open my lips so wide as a bristle may enter in way of thy excuse. My lady will hang thee for thy absence. Let her hang me: he that is well hanged in this world needs to fear no colours. Make that good. He shall see none to fear. A good lenten answer: I can tell thee where that saying was born, of, 'I fear no colours.' Where, good Mistress Mary? In the wars; and that may you be bold to say in your foolery. Well, God give them wisdom that have it; and those that are fools, let them use their talents. Yet you will be hanged for being so long absent; or, to be turned away, is not that as good as a hanging to you? Many a good hanging prevents a bad marriage; and, for turning away, let summer bear it out. You are resolute then? Not so, neither; but I am resolved on two points. That if one break, the other will hold; or, if both break, your gaskins fall. Apt, in good faith; very apt. Well, go thy way: if Sir Toby would leave drinking, thou wert as witty a piece of Eve's flesh as any in Illyria. Peace, you rogue, no more o' that. Here comes my lady: make your excuse wisely, you were best. Wit, an't be thy will, put me into good fooling! Those wits that think they have thee, do very oft prove fools; and I, that am sure I lack thee, may pass for a wise man: for what says Quinapalus? 'Better a witty fool than a foolish wit.' God bless thee, lady! Take the fool away. Do you not hear, fellows? Take away the lady. Go to, you're a dry fool; I'll no more of you: besides, you grow dishonest. Two faults, madonna, that drink and good counsel will amend: for give the dry fool drink, then is the fool not dry; bid the dishonest man mend himself: if he mend, he is no longer dishonest; if he cannot, let the botcher mend him. Any thing that's mended is but patched: virtue that transgresses is but patched with sin; and sin that amends is but patched with virtue. If that this simple syllogism will serve, so; if it will not, what remedy? As there is no true cuckold but calamity, so beauty's a flower. The lady bade take away the fool; therefore, I say again, take her away. Sir, I bade them take away you. Misprision in the highest degree! Lady, cucullus non facit monachum; that's as much to say as I wear not motley in my brain. Good madonna, give me leave to prove you a fool. Can you do it? Dexteriously, good madonna. Make your proof. I must catechise you for it, madonna: good my mouse of virtue, answer me. Well, sir, for want of other idleness, I'll bide your proof. Good madonna, why mournest thou? Good fool, for my brother's death. I think his soul is in hell, madonna. I know his soul is in heaven, fool. The more fool, madonna, to mourn for your brother's soul being in heaven. Take away the fool, gentlemen. What think you of this fool, Malvolio? doth he not mend? Yes; and shall do, till the pangs of death shake him: infirmity, that decays the wise, doth ever make the better fool. God send you, sir, a speedy infirmity, for the better increasing your folly! Sir Toby will be sworn that I am no fox, but he will not pass his word for two pence that you are no fool. How say you to that, Malvolio? I marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a barren rascal: I saw him put down the other day with an ordinary fool that has no more brain than a stone. Look you now, he's out of his guard already; unless you laugh and minister occasion to him, he is gagged. I protest, I take these wise men, that crow so at these set kind of fools, no better than the fools' zanies. O! you are sick of self-love, Malvolio, and taste with a distempered appetite. To be generous, guiltless, and of free disposition, is to take those things for bird-bolts that you deem cannon-bullets. There is no slander in an allowed fool, though he do nothing but rail; nor no railing in a known discreet man, though he do nothing but reprove. Now, Mercury endue thee with leasing, for thou speakest well of fools! Madam, there is at the gate a young gentleman much desires to speak with you. From the Count Orsino, is it? I know not, madam: 'tis a fair young man, and well attended. Who of my people hold him in delay? Sir Toby, madam, your kinsman. Fetch him off, I pray you: he speaks nothing but madman. Fie on him! Go you, Malvolio: if it be a suit from the count, I am sick, or not at home; what you will, to dismiss it. Now you see, sir, how your fooling grows old, and people dislike it. Thou hast spoken for us, madonna, as if thy eldest son should be a fool; whose skull Jove cram with brains! for here comes one of thy kin has a most weak pia mater. By mine honour, half drunk. What is he at the gate, cousin? A gentleman. A gentleman! what gentleman? 'Tis a gentleman here,â€”a plague o' these pickle herring! How now, sot! Good Sir Toby. Cousin, cousin, how have you come so early by this lethargy? Lechery! I defy lechery! There's one at the gate. Ay, marry, what is he? Let him be the devil, an he will, I care not: give me faith, say I. Well, it's all one. What's a drunken man like, fool? Like a drowned man, a fool, and a madman: one draught above heat makes him a fool, the second mads him, and a third drowns him. Go thou and seek the crowner, and let him sit o' my coz; for he's in the third degree of drink, he's drowned: go, look after him. He is but mad yet, madonna; and the fool shall look to the madman. Madam, yond young fellow swears he will speak with you. I told him you were sick: he takes on him to understand so much, and therefore comes to speak with you. I told him you were asleep: he seems to have a foreknowledge of that too, and therefore comes to speak with you. What is to be said to him, lady? he's fortified against any denial. Tell him he shall not speak with me. Ha's been told so; and he says, he'll stand at your door like a sheriff's post, and be the supporter to a bench, but he'll speak with you. What kind o' man is he? Why, of mankind. What manner of man? Of very ill manner: he'll speak with you, will you or no. Of what personage and years is he? Not yet old enough for a man, nor young enough for a boy; as a squash is before 'tis a peascod, or a codling when 'tis almost an apple: 'tis with him in standing water, between boy and man. He is very well-favoured, and he speaks very shrewishly: one would think his mother's milk were scarce out of him. Let him approach. Call in my gentlewoman. Gentlewoman, my lady calls. Give me my veil: come, throw it o'er my face. We'll once more hear Orsino's embassy. The honourable lady of the house, which is she? Speak to me; I shall answer for her. Your will? Most radiant, exquisite, and unmatchable beauty,â€”I pray you tell me if this be the lady of the house, for I never saw her: I would be loath to cast away my speech; for, besides that it is excellently well penned, I have taken great pains to con it. Good beauties, let me sustain no scorn; I am very comptible, even to the least sinister usage. Whence came you, sir? I can say little more than I have studied, and that question's out of my part. Good gentle one, give me modest assurance if you be the lady of the house, that I may proceed in my speech. Are you a comedian? No, my profound heart; and yet, by the very fangs of malice I swear I am not that I play. Are you the lady of the house? If I do not usurp myself, I am. Most certain, if you are she, you do usurp yourself; for, what is yours to bestow is not yours to reserve. But this is from my commission: I will on with my speech in your praise, and then show you the heart of my message. Come to what is important in't: I forgive you the praise. Alas! I took great pains to study it, and 'tis poetical. It is the more like to be feigned: I pray you keep it in. I heard you were saucy at my gates, and allowed your approach rather to wonder at you than to hear you. If you be not mad, be gone; if you have reason, be brief: 'tis not that time of moon with me to make one in so skipping a dialogue. Will you hoist sail, sir? here lies your way. No, good swabber; I am to hull here a little longer. Some mollification for your giant, sweet lady. Tell me your mind. I am a messenger. Sure, you have some hideous matter to deliver, when the courtesy of it is so fearful. Speak your office. It alone concerns your ear. I bring no overture of war, no taxation of homage: I hold the olive in my hand; my words are as full of peace as matter. Yet you began rudely. What are you? what would you? The rudeness that hath appear'd in me have I learn'd from my entertainment. What I am, and what I would, are as secret as maiden-head; to your ears, divinity; to any other's, profanation. Give us the place alone: we will hear this divinity. Now, sir; what is your text? Most sweet lady,â€” A comfortable doctrine, and much may be said of it. Where lies your text? In Orsino's bosom. In his bosom! In what chapter of his bosom? To answer by the method, in the first of his heart. O! I have read it: it is heresy. Have you no more to say? Good madam, let me see your face. Have you any commission from your lord to negotiate with my face? you are now out of your text: but we will draw the curtain and show you the picture. Look you, sir, such a one I was as this present: is't not well done? Excellently done, if God did all. 'Tis in grain, sir; 'twill endure wind and weather. 'Tis beauty truly blent, whose red and white Nature's own sweet and cunning hand laid on: Lady, you are tho cruell'st she alive, If you will lead these graces to the grave And leave the world no copy. O! sir, I will not be so hard-hearted; I will give out divers schedules of my beauty: it shall be inventoried, and every particle and utensil labelled to my will: as Item, Two lips, indifferent red; Item, Two grey eyes, with lids to them; Item, One neck, one chin, and so forth. Were you sent hither to praise me? I see you what you are: you are too proud; But, if you were the devil, you are fair. My lord and master loves you: O! such love Could be but recompens'd, though you were crown'd The nonpareil of beauty. How does he love me? With adorations, with fertile tears, With groans that thunder love, with sighs of fire. Your lord does know my mind; I cannot love him; Yet I suppose him virtuous, know him noble, Of great estate, of fresh and stainless youth; In voices well divulg'd, free, learn'd, and valiant; And, in dimension and the shape of nature A gracious person; but yet I cannot love him: He might have took his answer long ago. If I did love you in my master's flame, With such a suffering, such a deadly life, In your denial I would find no sense; I would not understand it. Why, what would you? Make me a willow cabin at your gate, And call upon my soul within the house; Write loyal cantons of contemned love, And sing them loud even in the dead of night; Holla your name to the reverberate hills, And make the babbling gossip of the air Cry out, 'Olivia!' O! you should not rest Between the elements of air and earth, But you should pity me! You might do much. What is your parentage? Above my fortune, yet my state is well: I am a gentleman. Get you to your lord: I cannot love him. Let him send no more, Unless, perchance, you come to me again, To tell me how he takes it. Fare you well: I thank you for your pains: spend this for me. I am no fee'd post, lady; keep your purse: My master, not myself, lacks recompense. Love make his heart of flint that you shall love, And let your fervour, like my master's, be Plac'd in contempt! Farewell, fair cruelty. 'What is your parentage?' 'Above my fortunes, yet my state is well: I am a gentleman.' I'll be sworn thou art: Thy tongue, thy face, thy limbs, actions, and spirit, Do give thee five-fold blazon. Not too fast: soft! soft! Unless the master were the man. How now! Even so quickly may one catch the plague? Methinks I feel this youth's perfections With an invisible and subtle stealth To creep in at mine eyes. Well, let it be. What, ho! Malvolio! Here, madam, at your service. Run after that same peevish messenger, The county's man: he left this ring behind him, Would I, or not: tell him I'll none of it. Desire him not to flatter with his lord, Nor hold him up with hopes: I'm not for him. If that the youth will come this way to-morrow, I'll give him reasons for't. Hie thee, Malvolio. Madam, I will. I do I know not what, and fear to find Mine eye too great a flatterer for my mind. Fate, show thy force: ourselves we do not owe; What is decreed must be, and be this so! Will you stay no longer? nor will you not that I go with you? By your patience, no. My stars shine darkly over me; the malignancy of my fate might, perhaps, distemper yours; therefore I shall crave of you your leave that I may bear my evils alone. It were a bad recompense for your love to lay any of them on you. Let me yet know of you whither you are bound. No, sooth, sir: my determinate voyage is mere extravagancy. But I perceive in you so excellent a touch of modesty that you will not extort from me what I am willing to keep in; therefore, it charges me in manners the rather to express myself. You must know of me then, Antonio, my name is Sebastian, which I called Roderigo. My father was that Sebastian of Messaline, whom I know you have heard of. He left behind him myself and a sister, both born in an hour: if the heavens had been pleased, would we had so ended! but you, sir, altered that; for some hour before you took me from the breach of the sea was my sister drowned. Alas the day! A lady, sir, though it was said she much resembled me, was yet of many accounted beautiful: but, though I could not with such estimable wonder overfar believe that, yet thus far I will boldly publish her: she bore a mind that envy could not but call fair. She is drowned already, sir, with salt water, though I seem to drown her remembrance again with more. Pardon me, sir, your bad entertainment. O good Antonio! forgive me your trouble! If you will not murder me for my love, let me be your servant. If you will not undo what you have done, that is, kill him whom you have recovered, desire it not. Fare ye well at once: my bosom is full of kindness; and I am yet so near the manners of my mother, that upon the least occasion more mine eyes will tell tales of me. I am bound to the Count Orsino's court: farewell. The gentleness of all the gods go with thee! I have many enemies in Orsino's court, Else would I very shortly see thee there; But, come what may, I do adore thee so, That danger shall seem sport, and I will go. Were not you even now with the Countess Olivia? Even now, sir: on a moderate pace I have since arrived but hither. She returns this ring to you, sir: you might have saved me my pains, to have taken it away yourself. She adds, moreover, that you should put your lord into a desperate assurance she will none of him. And one thing more; that you be never so hardy to come again in his affairs, unless it be to report your lord's taking of this. Receive it so. She took the ring of me; I'll none of it. Come, sir, you peevishly threw it to her; and her will is it should be so returned: if it be worth stooping for, there it lies in your eye; if not, be it his that finds it. I left no ring with her: what means this lady? Fortune forbid my outside have not charm'd her! She made good view of me; indeed, so much, That sure methought her eyes had lost her tongue, For she did speak in starts distractedly. She loves me, sure; the cunning of her passion Invites me in this churlish messenger. None of my lord's ring! why, he sent her none. I am the man: if it be so, as 'tis, Poor lady, she were better love a dream. Disguise, I see, thou art a wickedness, Wherein the pregnant enemy does much. How easy is it for the proper-false In women's waxen hearts to set their forms! Alas! our frailty is the cause, not we! For such as we are made of, such we be. How will this fadge? My master loves her dearly; And I, poor monster, fond as much on him; And she, mistaken, seems to dote on me. What will become of this? As I am man, My state is desperate for my master's love; As I am woman,â€”now alas the day!â€” What thriftless sighs shall poor Olivia breathe! O time! thou must untangle this, not I; It is too hard a knot for me to untie. Approach, Sir Andrew: not to be a-bed after midnight is to be up betimes; and diluculo surgere, thou knowest,â€” Nay, by my troth, I know not; but I know, to be up late is to be up late. A false conclusion: I hate it as an unfilled can. To be up after midnight and to go to bed then, is early; so that to go to bed after midnight is to go to bed betimes. Does not our life consist of the four elements? Faith, so they say; but, I think, it rather consists of eating and drinking. Thou art a scholar; let us therefore eat and drink. Marian, I say! a stoup of wine! Here comes the fool, i' faith. How now, my hearts! Did you never see the picture of 'we three?' Welcome, ass. Now let's have a catch. By my troth, the fool has an excellent breast. I had rather than forty shillings I had such a leg, and so sweet a breath to sing, as the fool has. In sooth, thou wast in very gracious fooling last night, when thou spokest of Pigrogromitus, of the Vapians passing the equinoctial of Queubus: 'twas very good, i' faith. I sent thee sixpence for thy leman: hadst it? I did impeticos thy gratillity; for Malvolio's nose is no whipstock: my lady has a white hand, and the Myrmidons are no bottleale houses. Excellent! Why, this is the best fooling, when all is done. Now, a song. Come on; there is sixpence for you: let's have a song. There's a testril of me too: if one knight give aâ€” Would you have a love-song, or a song of good life? A love-song, a love-song. Ay, ay; I care not for good life. O mistress mine! where are you roaming? O! stay and hear; your true love's coming, That can sing both high and low. Trip no further, pretty sweeting; Journeys end in lovers meeting, Every wise man's son doth know. Excellent good, i' faith. Good, good. What is love? 'tis not hereafter; Present mirth hath present laughter; What's to come is still unsure: In delay there lies no plenty; Then come kiss me, sweet and twenty, Youth's a stuff will not endure. A mellifluous voice, as I am true knight. A contagious breath. Very sweet and contagious, i' faith. To hear by the nose, it is dulcet in contagion. But shall we make the welkin dance indeed? Shall we rouse the night-owl in a catch that will draw three souls out of one weaver? shall we do that? An you love me, let's do't: I am dog at a catch. By'r lady, sir, and some dogs will catch well. Most certain. Let our catch be, 'Thou knave.' Hold thy peace, thou knave,' knight? I shall be constrain'd in't to call thee knave, knight. 'Tis not the first time I have constrained one to call me knave. Begin, fool: it begins, 'Hold thy peace.' I shall never begin if I hold my peace. Good, i' faith. Come, begin. What a caterwauling do you keep here! If my lady have not called up her steward Malvolio and bid him turn you out of doors, never trust me. My lady's a Cataian; we are politicians; Malvolio's a Peg-a-Ramsey, and 'Three merry men be we.' Am not I consanguineous? am I not of her blood? Tillyvally, lady! There dwelt a man in Babylon, lady, lady! Beshrew me, the knight's in admirable fooling. Ay, he does well enough if he be disposed, and so do I too: he does it with a better grace, but I do it more natural. O! the twelfth day of December,â€” For the love o' God, peace! My masters, are you mad? or what are you? Have you no wit, manners, nor honesty, but to gabble like tinkers at this time of night? Do ye make an alehouse of my lady's house, that ye squeak out your coziers' catches without any mitigation or remorse of voice? Is there no respect of place, persons, nor time, in you? We did keep time, sir, in our catches. Sneck up! Sir Toby, I must be round with you. My lady bade me tell you, that, though she harbours you as her kinsman, she's nothing allied to your disorders. If you can separate yourself and your misdemeanours, you are welcome to the house; if not, an it would please you to take leave of her, she is very willing to bid you farewell. Farewell, dear heart, since I must needs be gone. Nay, good Sir Toby. His eyes do show his days are almost done. Is't even so? But I will never die. Sir Toby, there you lie. This is much credit to you. Shall I bid him go? What an if you do? Shall I bid him go, and spare not? O! no, no, no, no, you dare not. 'Out o' time!' Sir, ye lie. Art any more than a steward? Dost thou think, because thou art virtuous, there shall be no more cakes and ale? Yes, by Saint Anne; and ginger shall be hot i' the mouth too. Thou'rt i' the right. Go, sir, rub your chain with crumbs. A stoup of wine, Maria! Mistress Mary, if you prized my lady's favour at anything more than contempt, you would not give means for this uncivil rule: she shall know of it, by this hand. Go shake your ears. 'Twere as good a deed as to drink when a man's a-hungry, to challenge him the field, and then to break promise with him and make a fool of him. Do't, knight: I'll write thee a challenge; or I'll deliver thy indignation to him by word of mouth. Sweet Sir Toby, be patient for to-night: since the youth of the count's was to-day with my lady, she is much out of quiet. For Monsieur Malvolio, let me alone with him: if I do not gull him into a nayword, and make him a common recreation, do not think I have wit enough to lie straight in my bed. I know I can do it. Possess us, possess us; tell us something of him. Marry, sir, sometimes he is a kind of puritan. O! if I thought that, I'd beat him like a dog. What, for being a puritan? thy exquisite reason, dear knight? I have no exquisite reason for't, but I have reason good enough. The devil a puritan that he is, or anything constantly but a time-pleaser; an affectioned ass, that cons state without book, and utters it by great swarths: the best persuaded of himself; so crammed, as he thinks, with excellences, that it is his ground of faith that all that look on him love him; and on that vice in him will my revenge find notable cause to work. What wilt thou do? I will drop in his way some obscure epistles of love; wherein, by the colour of his beard, the shape of his leg, the manner of his gait, the expressure of his eye, forehead, and complexion, he shall find himself most feelingly personated. I can write very like my lady your niece; on a forgotten matter we can hardly make distinction of our hands. Excellent! I smell a device. I have't in my nose too. He shall think, by the letters that thou wilt drop, that they come from my niece, and that she is in love with him. My purpose is, indeed, a horse of that colour. And your horse now would make him an ass. Ass, I doubt not. O! 'twill be admirable. Sport royal, I warrant you: I know my physic will work with him. I will plant you two, and let the fool make a third, where he shall find the letter: observe his construction of it. For this night, to bed, and dream on the event. Farewell. Good night, Penthesilea. Before me, she's a good wench. She's a beagle, true-bred, and one that adores me: what o' that? I was adored once too. Let's to bed, knight. Thou hadst need send for more money. If I cannot recover your niece, I am a foul way out. Send for money, knight: if thou hast her not i' the end, call me cut. If I do not, never trust me, take it how you will. Come, come: I'll go burn some sack; 'tis too late to go to bed now. Come, knight; come, knight. Give me some music. Now, good morrow, friends: Now, good Cesario, but that piece of song, That old and antique song we heard last night; Methought it did relieve my passion much, More than light airs and recollected terms Of these most brisk and giddy-paced times: Come; but one verse. He is not here, so please your lordship, that should sing it. Who was it? Feste, the jester, my lord; a fool that the Lady Olivia's father took much delight in. He is about the house. Seek him out, and play the tune the while. Come hither, boy: if ever thou shalt love, In the sweet pangs of it remember me; For such as I am all true lovers are: Unstaid and skittish in all motions else Save in the constant image of the creature That is belov'd. How dost thou like this tune? It gives a very echo to the seat Where love is thron'd. Thou dost speak masterly. My life upon't, young though thou art, thine eye Hath stay'd upon some favour that it loves; Hath it not, boy? A little, by your favour. What kind of woman is't? Of your complexion. She is not worth thee, then. What years, i' faith? About your years, my lord. Too old, by heaven. Let still the woman take An elder than herself, so wears she to him, So sways she level in her husband's heart: For, boy, however we do praise ourselves, Our fancies are more giddy and unfirm, More longing, wavering, sooner lost and worn, Than women's are. I think it well, my lord. Then, let thy love be younger than thyself, Or thy affection cannot hold the bent; For women are as roses, whose fair flower Being once display'd, doth fall that very hour. And so they are: alas, that they are so; To die, even when they to perfection grow! O, fellow! come, the song we had last night. Mark it, Cesario; it is old and plain; The spinsters and the knitters in the sun, And the free maids that weave their thread with bones, Do use to chant it: it is silly sooth, And dallies with the innocence of love, Like the old age. Are you ready, sir? Ay; prithee, sing. Come away, come away, death, And in sad cypress let me be laid; Fly away, fly away, breath; I am slain by a fair cruel maid. My shroud of white, stuck all with yew, O! prepare it My part of death, no one so true Did share it. Not a flower, not a flower sweet, On my black coffin let there be strown, Not a friend, not a friend greet My poor corse, where my bones shall be thrown. A thousand thousand sighs to save, Lay me, O! where Sad true lover never find my grave, To weep there. There's for thy pains. No pains, sir; I take pleasure in singing, sir. I'll pay thy pleasure then. Truly, sir, and pleasure will be paid, one time or another. Give me now leave to leave thee. Now, the melancholy god protect thee, and the tailor make thy doublet of changeable taffeta, for thy mind is a very opal! I would have men of such constancy put to sea, that their business might be everything and their intent everywhere; for that's it that always makes a good voyage of nothing. Farewell. Let all the rest give place. Once more, Cesario, Get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty: Tell her, my love, more noble than the world, Prizes not quantity of dirty lands; The parts that fortune hath bestow'd upon her, Tell her, I hold as giddily as fortune; But 'tis that miracle and queen of gems That nature pranks her in attracts my soul. But if she cannot love you, sir? I cannot be so answer'd. Sooth, but you must. Say that some lady, as perhaps, there is, Hath for your love as great a pang of heart As you have for Olivia: you cannot love her; You tell her so; must she not then be answer'd? There is no woman's sides Can bide the beating of so strong a passion As love doth give my heart; no woman's heart So big, to hold so much; they lack retention. Alas! their love may be call'd appetite, No motion of the liver, but the palate, That suffer surfeit, cloyment, and revolt; But mine is all as hungry as the sea, And can digest as much. Make no compare Between that love a woman can bear me And that I owe Olivia. Ay, but I know,â€” What dost thou know? Too well what love women to men may owe: In faith, they are as true of heart as we. My father had a daughter lov'd a man, As it might be, perhaps, were I a woman, I should your lordship. And what's her history? A blank, my lord. She never told her love, But let concealment, like a worm i' the bud, Feed on her damask cheek: she pin'd in thought, And with a green and yellow melancholy, She sat like Patience on a monument, Smiling at grief. Was not this love indeed? We men may say more, swear more; but indeed Our shows are more than will, for still we prove Much in our vows, but little in our love. But died thy sister of her love, my boy? I am all the daughters of my father's house, And all the brothers too; and yet I know not. Sir, shall I to this lady? Ay, that's the theme. To her in haste; give her this jewel; say My love can give no place, bide no denay. Come thy ways, Signior Fabian. Nay, I'll come: if I lose a scruple of this sport, let me be boiled to death with melancholy. Wouldst thou not be glad to have the niggardly rascally sheep-biter come by some notable shame? I would exult, man: you know he brought me out o' favour with my lady about a bear-baiting here. To anger him we'll have the bear again; and we will fool him black and blue; shall we not, Sir Andrew? An we do not, it is pity of our lives. Here comes the little villain. How now, my metal of India! Get ye all three into the box-tree. Malvolio's coming down this walk: he has been yonder i' the sun practising behaviour to his own shadow this half-hour. Observe him, for the love of mockery; for I know this letter will make a contemplative idiot of him. Close, in the name of jesting! Lie thou there: for here comes the trout that must be caught with tickling. 'Tis but fortune; all is fortune. Maria once told me she did affect me; and I have heard herself come thus near, that should she fancy, it should be one of my complexion. Besides, she uses me with a more exalted respect than anyone else that follows her. What should I think on't? Here's an over-weening rogue! O, peace! Contemplation makes a rare turkey-cock of him: how he jets under his advanced plumes! 'Slight, I could so beat the rogue! Peace! I say. To be Count Malvolio! Ah, rogue! Pistol him, pistol him. Peace! peace! There is example for't: the lady of the Strachy married the yeoman of the wardrobe. Fie on him, Jezebel! O, peace! now he's deeply in; look how imagination blows him. Having been three months married to her, sitting in my state,â€” O! for a stone-bow, to hit him in the eye! Calling my officers about me, in my branched velvet gown; having come from a daybed, where I have left Olivia sleeping,â€” Fire and brimstone! O, peace! peace! And then to have the humour of state: and after a demure travel of regard, telling them I know my place, as I would they should do theirs, to ask for my kinsman Toby,â€” Bolts and shackles! O, peace, peace, peace! now, now. Seven of my people, with an obedient start, make out for him. I frown the while; and perchance wind up my watch, or play with myâ€”some rich jewel. Toby approaches; curtsies there to me,â€” Shall this fellow live? Though our silence be drawn from us with cars, yet peace! I extend my hand to him thus, quenching my familiar smile with an austere regard of control,â€” And does not Toby take you a blow o' the lips then? Saying, 'Cousin Toby, my fortunes having cast me on your niece give me this prerogative of speech,'â€” What, what? 'You must amend your drunkenness.' Out, scab! Nay, patience, or we break the sinews of our plot. 'Besides, you waste the treasure of your time with a foolish knight,'â€” That's me, I warrant you. 'One Sir Andrew,'â€” I knew 'twas I; for many do call me fool. What employment have we here? Now is the woodcock near the gin. O, peace! and the spirit of humours intimate reading aloud to him! By my life, this is my lady's hand! these be her very C's, her U's, and her T's; and thus makes she her great P's. It is, in contempt of question, her hand. Her C's, her U's, and her T's: why thatâ€” To the unknown beloved, this and my good wishes: her very phrases! By your leave, wax. Soft! and the impressure her Lucrece, with which she uses to seal: 'tis my lady. To whom should this be? This wins him, liver and all. Jove knows I love; But who? Lips, do not move No man must know. 'No man must know.' What follows? the numbers altered! 'No man must know:' if this should be thee, Malvolio! Marry, hang thee, brock! I may command where I adore; But silence, like a Lucrece knife, With bloodless stroke my heart doth gore: M, O, A, I, doth sway my life. A fustian riddle! Excellent wench, say I. 'M, O, A, I, doth sway my life.' Nay, but first, let me see, let me see, let me see. What dish o' poison has she dressed him! And with what wing the staniel checks at it! 'I may command where I adore.' Why, she may command me: I serve her; she is my lady. Why, this is evident to any formal capacity; there is no obstruction in this. And the end, what should that alphabetical position portend? if I could make that resemble something in me,â€”Softly!â€”M, O, A, I,â€” O! ay, make up that: he is now at a cold scent. Sowter will cry upon 't, for all this, though it be as rank as a fox. M, Malvolio; M, why, that begins my name. Did not I say he would work it out? the cur is excellent at faults. M,â€”But then there is no consonancy in the sequel; that suffers under probation: A should follow, but O does. And O shall end, I hope. Ay, or I'll cudgel him, and make him cry, O! And then I comes behind. Ay, an you had any eye behind you, you might see more detraction at your heels than fortunes before you. M, O, A, I; this simulation is not as the former; and yet, to crush this a little, it would bow to me, for every one of these letters are in my name. Soft! here follows prose. If this fall into thy hand, revolve. In my stars I am above thee; but be not afraid of greatness: some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them. Thy Fates open their hands; let thy blood and spirit embrace them; and to inure thyself to what thou art like to be, cast thy humble slough, and appear fresh. Be opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants; let thy tongue tang arguments of state; put thyself into the trick of singularity She thus advises thee that sighs for thee. Remember who commended thy yellow stockings, and wished to see thee ever cross-gartered: I say, remember. Go to, thou art made, if thou desirest to be so; if not, let me see thee a steward still, the fellow of servants, and not worthy to touch Fortune's fingers. Farewell. She that would alter services with thee. THE FORTUNATE-UNHAPPY. Daylight and champian discovers not more: this is open. I will be proud, I will read politic authors, I will baffle Sir Toby, I will wash off gross acquaintance, I will be point-devise the very man. I do not now fool myself, to let imagination jade me, for every reason excites to this, that my lady loves me. She did commend my yellow stockings of late, she did praise my leg being cross-gartered; and in this she manifests herself to my love, and, with a kind of injunction drives me to these habits of her liking. I thank my stars I am happy. I will be strange, stout, in yellow stockings, and cross-gartered, even with the swiftness of putting on. Jove and my stars be praised! Here is yet a postscript. Thou canst not choose but know who I am. If thou entertainest my love, let it appear in thy smiling; thy smiles become thee well; therefore in my presence still smile, dear my sweet, I prithee. Jove, I thank thee. I will smile: I will do everything that thou wilt have me. I will not give my part of this sport for a pension of thousands to be paid from the Sophy. I could marry this wench for this device. So could I too. And ask no other dowry with her but such another jest. Nor I neither. Here comes my noble gull-catcher. Wilt thou set thy foot o' my neck? Or o' mine either? Shall I play my freedom at tray-trip, and become thy bond-slave? I' faith, or I either? Why, thou hast put him in such a dream, that when the image of it leaves him he must run mad. Nay, but say true; does it work upon him? Like aqua-vitÃ¦ with a midwife. If you will, then see the fruits of the sport, mark his first approach before my lady; he will come to her in yellow stockings, and 'tis a colour she abhors; and cross-gartered, a fashion she detests; and he will smile upon her, which will now be so unsuitable to her disposition, being addicted to a melancholy as she is, that it cannot but turn him into a notable contempt. If you will see it, follow me. To the gates of Tartar, thou most excellent devil of wit! I'll make one too. Save thee, friend, and thy music. Dost thou live by thy tabor? No, sir, I live by the church. Art thou a churchman? No such matter, sir: I do live by the church; for I do live at my house, and my house doth stand by the church. So thou mayst say, the king lies by a beggar, if a beggar dwell near him; or, the church stands by thy tabor, if thy tabor stand by the church. You have said, sir. To see this age! A sentence is but a cheveril glove to a good wit: how quickly the wrong side may be turned outward! Nay, that's certain: they that dally nicely with words may quickly make them wanton. I would therefore my sister had had no name, sir. Why, man? Why, sir, her name's a word; and to dally with that word might make my sister wanton. But indeed, words are very rascals since bonds disgraced them. Thy reason, man? Troth, sir, I can yield you none without words; and words are grown so false, I am loath to prove reason with them. I warrant thou art a merry fellow, and carest for nothing. Not so, sir, I do care for something; but in my conscience, sir, I do not care for you: if that be to care for nothing, sir, I would it would make you invisible. Art not thou the Lady Olivia's fool? No, indeed, sir; the Lady Olivia has no folly: she will keep no fool, sir, till she be married; and fools are as like husbands as pilchards are to herringsâ€”the husband's the bigger. I am indeed not her fool, but her corrupter of words. I saw thee late at the Count Orsino's. Foolery, sir, does walk about the orb like the sun; it shines every where. I would be sorry, sir, but the fool should be as oft with your master as with my mistress. I think I saw your wisdom there. Nay, an thou pass upon me, I'll no more with thee. Hold, there's sixpence for thee. Now Jove, in his next commodity of hair, send thee a beard! By my troth, I'll tell thee, I am almost sick for one, though I would not have it grow on my chin. Is thy lady within? Would not a pair of these have bred, sir? Yes, being kept together and put to use. I would play Lord Pandarus of Phrygia, sir, to bring a Cressida to this Troilus. I understand you, sir; 'tis well begg'd. The matter, I hope, is not great, sir, begging but a beggar: Cressida was a beggar. My lady is within, sir. I will conster to them whence you come; who you are and what you would are out of my welkin; I might say 'element,' but the word is overworn. This fellow's wise enough to play the fool, And to do that well craves a kind of wit: He must observe their mood on whom he jests, The quality of persons, and the time, And, like the haggard, check at every feather That comes before his eye. This is a practice As full of labour as a wise man's art; For folly that he wisely shows is fit; But wise men folly-fall'n, quite taint their wit. Save you, gentleman. And you, sir. Dieu vous garde, monsieur. Et vous aussi; votre serviteur. I hope, sir, you are; and I am yours. Will you encounter the house? my niece is desirous you should enter, if your trade be to her. I am bound to your niece, sir: I mean, she is the list of my voyage. Taste your legs, sir: put them to motion. My legs do better understand me, sir, than I understand what you mean by bidding me taste my legs. I mean, to go, sir, to enter. I will answer you with gait and entrance. But we are prevented. Most excellent accomplished lady, the heavens rain odours on you! That youth's a rare courtier. 'Rain odours!' well. My matter hath no voice, lady, but to your own most pregnant and vouchsafed ear. 'Odours,' 'pregnant,' and 'vouchsafed.' I'll get 'em all three all ready. Let the garden door be shut, and leave me to my hearing. Give me your hand, sir. My duty, madam, and most humble service. What is your name? Cesario is your servant's name, fair princess. My servant, sir! 'Twas never merry world Since lowly feigning was call'd compliment. You're servant to the Count Orsino, youth. And he is yours, and his must needs be yours: Your servant's servant is your servant, madam. For him, I think not on him: for his thoughts, Would they were blanks rather than fill'd with me! Madam, I come to whet your gentle thoughts On his behalf. O! by your leave, I pray you, I bade you never speak again of him: But, would you undertake another suit, I had rather hear you to solicit that Than music from the spheres. Dear lady,â€” Give me leave, beseech you. I did send, After the last enchantment you did here, A ring in chase of you: so did I abuse Myself, my servant, and, I fear me, you: Under your hard construction must I sit, To force that on you, in a shameful cunning, Which you knew none of yours: what might you think? Have you not set mine honour at the stake, And baited it with all th' unmuzzled thoughts That tyrannous heart can think? To one of your receiving Enough is shown; a cypress, not a bosom, Hideth my heart. So, let me hear you speak. I pity you. That's a degree to love. No, not a grize; for 'tis a vulgar proof That very oft we pity enemies. Why, then methinks 'tis time to smile again. O world! how apt the poor are to be proud. If one should be a prey, how much the better To fall before the lion than the wolf! The clock upbraids me with the waste of time. Be not afraid, good youth, I will not have you: And yet, when wit and youth is come to harvest, Your wife is like to reap a proper man: There lies your way, due west. Then westward-ho! Grace and good disposition attend your ladyship! You'll nothing, madam, to my lord by me? Stay: I prithee, tell me what thou think'st of me. That you do think you are not what you are. If I think so, I think the same of you. Then think you right: I am not what I am. I would you were as I would have you be! Would it be better, madam, than I am? I wish it might, for now I am your fool. O! what a deal of scorn looks beautiful In the contempt and anger of his lip. A murderous guilt shows not itself more soon Than love that would seem hid; love's night is noon. Cesario, by the roses of the spring, By maidhood, honour, truth, and every thing, I love thee so, that, maugre all thy pride, Nor wit nor reason can my passion hide. Do not extort thy reasons from this clause, For that I woo, thou therefore hast no cause; But rather reason thus with reason fetter, Love sought is good, but giv'n unsought is better. By innocence I swear, and by my youth, I have one heart, one bosom, and one truth, And that no woman has; nor never none Shall mistress be of it, save I alone. And so adieu, good madam: never more Will I my master's tears to you deplore. Yet come again, for thou perhaps mayst move That heart, which now abhors, to like his love. No, faith, I'll not stay a jot longer. Thy reason, dear venom; give thy reason. You must needs yield your reason, Sir Andrew. Marry, I saw your niece do more favours to the count's serving-man than ever she bestowed upon me; I saw't i' the orchard. Did she see thee the while, old boy? tell me that. As plain as I see you now. This was a great argument of love in her toward you. 'Slight! will you make an ass o' me? I will prove it legitimate, sir, upon the oaths of judgment and reason. And they have been grand-jurymen since before Noah was a sailor. She did show favour to the youth in your sight only to exasperate you, to awake your dormouse valour, to put fire in your heart, and brimstone in your liver. You should then have accosted her, and with some excellent jests, firenew from the mint, you should have banged the youth into dumbness. This was looked for at your hand, and this was balked: the double gilt of this opportunity you let time wash off, and you are now sailed into the north of my lady's opinion; where you will hang like an icicle on a Dutchman's beard, unless you do redeem it by some laudable attempt, either of valour or policy. An't be any way, it must be with valour, for policy I hate: I had as lief be a Brownist as a politician. Why, then, build me thy fortunes upon the basis of valour: challenge me the count's youth to fight with him; hurt him in eleven places: my niece shall take note of it; and assure thyself, there is no love-broker in the world can more prevail in man's commendation with woman than report of valour. There is no way but this, Sir Andrew. Will either of you bear me a challenge to him? Go, write it in a martial hand; be curst and brief; it is no matter how witty, so it be eloquent, and full of invention: taunt him with the licence of ink: if thou thou'st him some thrice, it shall not be amiss; and as many lies as will lie in thy sheet of paper, although the sheet were big enough for the bed of Ware in England, set 'em down: go, about it. Let there be gall enough in thy ink, though thou write with a goose-pen, no matter: about it. Where shall I find you? We'll call thee at the cubiculo: go. This is a dear manakin to you, Sir Toby. I have been dear to him, lad, some two thousand strong, or so. We shall have a rare letter from him; but you'll not deliver it. Never trust me, then; and by all means stir on the youth to an answer. I think oxen and wainropes cannot hale them together. For Andrew, if he were opened, and you find so much blood in his liver as will clog the foot of a flea, I'll eat the rest of the anatomy. And his opposite, the youth, bears in his visage no great presage of cruelty. Look, where the youngest wren of nine comes. If you desire the spleen, and will laugh yourselves into stitches, follow me. Yond gull Malvolio is turned heathen, a very renegado; for there is no Christian, that means to be saved by believing rightly, can ever believe such impossible passages of grossness. He's in yellow stockings. And cross-gartered? Most villanously; like a pedant that keeps a school i' the church. I have dogged him like his murderer. He does obey every point of the letter that I dropped to betray him: he does smile his face into more lines than are in the new map with the augmentation of the Indies. You have not seen such a thing as 'tis; I can hardly forbear hurling things at him. I know my lady will strike him: if she do, he'll smile and take't for a great favour. Come, bring us, bring us where he is. I would not by my will have troubled you; But since you make your pleasure of your pains, I will no further chide you. I could not stay behind you: my desire, More sharp than filed steel, did spur me forth; And not all love to see you,â€”though so much As might have drawn one to a longer voyage,â€” But jealousy what might befall your travel, Being skilless in these parts; which to a stranger, Unguided and unfriended, often prove Rough and unhospitable: my willing love, The rather by these arguments of fear, Set forth in your pursuit. My kind Antonio, I can no other answer make but thanks, And thanks, and ever thanks; for oft good turns Are shuffled off with such uncurrent pay: But, were my worth, as is my conscience, firm, You should find better dealing. What's to do? Shall we go see the reliques of this town? To-morrow, sir: best first go see your lodging. I am not weary, and 'tis long to night: I pray you, let us satisfy our eyes With the memorials and the things of fame That do renown this city. Would you'd pardon me; I do not without danger walk these streets: Once, in a sea-fight 'gainst the Count his galleys, I did some service; of such note indeed, That were I ta'en here it would scarce be answer'd. Belike you slew great number of his people? The offence is not of such a bloody nature, Albeit the quality of the time and quarrel Might well have given us bloody argument. It might have since been answer'd in repaying What we took from them; which, for traffic's sake, Most of our city did: only myself stood out; For which, if I be lapsed in this place, I shall pay dear. Do not then walk too open. It doth not fit me. Hold, sir; here's my purse. In the south suburbs, at the Elephant, Is best to lodge: I will bespeak our diet, Whiles you beguile the time and feed your knowledge With viewing of the town: there shall you have me. Why I your purse? Haply your eye shall light upon some toy You have desire to purchase; and your store, I think, is not for idle markets, sir. I'll be your purse-bearer and leave you for an hour. To the Elephant. I do remember. I have sent after him: he says he'll come; How shall I feast him? what bestow of him? For youth is bought more oft than begg'd or borrow'd. I speak too loud. Where is Malvolio? he is sad, and civil, And suits well for a servant with my fortunes: Where is Malvolio? He's coming, madam; but in very strange manner. He is sure possess'd, madam. Why, what's the matter? does he rave? No, madam; he does nothing but smile: your ladyship were best to have some guard about you if he come, for sure the man is tainted in's wits. Go call him hither. I am as mad as he, If sad and merry madness equal be. How now, Malvolio! Sweet lady, ho, ho. Smil'st thou? I sent for thee upon a sad occasion. Sad, lady! I could be sad: this does make some obstruction in the blood, this crossgartering; but what of that? if it please the eye of one, it is with me as the very true sonnet is, 'Please one and please all.' Why, how dost thou, man? what is the matter with thee? Not black in my mind, though yellow in my legs. It did come to his hands, and commands shall be executed: I think we do know the sweet Roman hand. Wilt thou go to bed, Malvolio? To bed! ay, sweetheart; and I'll come to thee. God comfort thee! Why dost thou smile so and kiss thy hand so oft? How do you, Malvolio? At your request! Yes; nightingales answer daws. Why appear you with this ridiculous boldness before my lady? 'Be not afraid of greatness:' 'Twas well writ. What meanest thou by that, Malvolio? 'Some are born great,'â€” Ha! 'Some achieve greatness,'â€” What sayst thou? 'And some have greatness thrust upon them.' Heaven restore thee! 'Remember who commended thy yellow stockings,'â€” Thy yellow stockings! 'And wished to see thee cross-gartered.' Cross-gartered! 'Go to, thou art made, if thou desirest to be so,'â€” Am I made? 'If not, let me see thee a servant still.' Why, this is very midsummer madness. Madam, the young gentleman of the Count Orsino's is returned. I could hardly entreat him back: he attends your ladyship's pleasure. I'll come to him. Good Maria, let this fellow be looked to. Where's my cousin Toby? Let some of my people have a special care of him: I would not have him miscarry for the half of my dowry. Oh, ho! do you come near me now? no worse man than Sir Toby to look to me! This concurs directly with the letter: she sends him on purpose, that I may appear stubborn to him; for she incites me to that in the letter. 'Cast thy humble slough,' says she; 'be opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants; let thy tongue tang with arguments of state; put thyself into the trick of singularity;' and consequently sets down the manner how; as, a sad face, a reverend carriage, a slow tongue, in the habit of some sir of note, and so forth. I have limed her; but it is Jove's doing, and Jove make me thankful! And when she went away now, 'Let this fellow be looked to;' fellow! not Malvolio, nor after my degree, but fellow. Why, everything adheres together, that no dram of a scruple, no scruple of a scruple, no obstacle, no incredulous or unsafe circumstanceâ€”What can be said? Nothing that can be can come between me and the full prospect of my hopes. Well, Jove, not I, is the doer of this, and he is to be thanked. Which way is he, in the name of sanctity? If all the devils in hell be drawn in little, and Legion himself possess'd him, yet I'll speak to him. Here he is, here he is. How is't with you, sir? how is't with you, man? Go off; I discard you: let me enjoy my private; go off. Lo, how hollow the fiend speaks within him! did not I tell you? Sir Toby, my lady prays you to have a care of him. Ah, ha! does she so? Go to, go to: peace! peace! we must deal gently with him; let me alone. How do you, Malvolio? how is't with you? What, man! defy the devil: consider, he's an enemy to mankind. Do you know what you say? La you! an you speak ill of the devil, how he takes it at heart. Pray God, he be not bewitched! Carry his water to the wise-woman. Marry, and it shall be done to-morrow morning, if I live. My lady would not lose him for more than I'll say. How now, mistress! O Lord! Prithee, hold thy peace; this is not the way: do you not see you move him? let me alone with him. No way but gentleness; gently, gently: the fiend is rough, and will not be roughly used. Why, how now, my bawcock! how dost thou, chuck? Sir! Ay, Biddy, come with me. What, man! 'tis not for gravity to play at cherry-pit with Satan: hang him, foul collier! Get him to say his prayers, good Sir Toby, get him to pray. My prayers, minx! No, I warrant you, he will not hear of godliness. Go, hang yourselves all! you are idle shallow things: I am not of your element. You shall know more hereafter. Is't possible? If this were played upon a stage now, I could condemn it as an improbable fiction. His very genius hath taken the infection of the device, man. Nay, pursue him now, lest the device take air, and taint. Why, we shall make him mad indeed. The house will be the quieter. Come, we'll have him in a dark room, and bound. My niece is already in the belief that he's mad: we may carry it thus, for our pleasure and his penance, till our very pastime, tired out of breath, prompt us to have mercy on him; at which time we will bring the device to the bar, and crown thee for a finder of madmen. But see, but see. More matter for a May morning. Here's the challenge; read it: I warrant there's vinegar and pepper in't. Is't so saucy? Ay, is't, I warrant him: do but read. Give me. Youth, whatsoever thou art, thou art but a scurvy fellow. Good, and valiant. Wonder not, nor admire not in thy mind, why I do call thee so, for I will show thee no reason for't, A good note, that keeps you from the blow of the law. Thou comest to the Lady Olivia, and in my sight she uses thee kindly: but thou liest in thy throat; that is not the matter I challenge thee for. Very brief, and to exceeding good senseâ€”less. I will waylay thee going home; where, if it be thy chance to kill me,â€” Good. Thou killest me like a rogue and a villain. Still you keep o' the windy side of the law: good. Fare thee well; and God have mercy upon one of our souls! He may have mercy upon mine, but my hope is better; and so look to thyself. Thy friend, as thou usest him, and thy sworn enemy, If this letter move him not, his legs cannot. I'll give't him. You may have very fit occasion for for't: he is now in some commerce with my lady, and will by and by depart. Go, Sir Andrew; scout me for him at the corner of the orchard like a bum-baily: so soon as ever thou seest him, draw; and, as thou drawest, swear horrible; for it comes to pass oft that a terrible oath, with a swaggering accent sharply twanged off, gives manhood more approbation than ever proof itself would have earned him. Away! Nay, let me alone for swearing. Now will not I deliver his letter: for the behaviour of the young gentleman gives him out to be of good capacity and breeding; his employment between his lord and my niece confirms no less: therefore this letter, being so excellently ignorant, will breed no terror in the youth: he will find it comes from a clodpole. But, sir, I will deliver his challenge by word of mouth; set upon Aguecheek a notable report of valour; and drive the gentleman,â€”as I know his youth will aptly receive it,â€”into a most hideous opinion of his rage, skill, fury, and impetuosity. This will so fright them both that they will kill one another by the look, like cockatrices. Here he comes with your niece: give them way till he take leave, and presently after him. I will meditate the while upon some horrid message for a challenge. I have said too much unto a heart of stone, And laid mine honour too unchary out: There's something in me that reproves my fault, But such a headstrong potent fault it is That it but mocks reproof. With the same haviour that your passion bears Goes on my master's griefs. Here; wear this jewel for me, 'tis my picture; Refuse it not; it hath no tongue to vex you; And I beseech you come again to-morrow. What shall you ask of me that I'll deny, That honour sav'd may upon asking give? Nothing but this; your true love for my master. How with mine honour may I give him that Which I have given to you? I will acquit you. Well, come again to-morrow: fare thee well: A fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell. Gentleman, God save thee. And you, sir. That defence thou hast, betake thee to't: of what nature the wrongs are thou hast done him, I know not; but thy intercepter, full of despite, bloody as the hunter, attends thee at the orchard-end. Dismount thy tuck, be yare in thy preparation, for thy assailant is quick, skilful, and deadly. You mistake, sir: I am sure no man hath any quarrel to me: my remembrance is very free and clear from any image of offence done to any man. You'll find it otherwise, I assure you: therefore, if you hold your life at any price, betake you to your guard; for your opposite hath in him what youth, strength, skill, and wrath, can furnish man withal. I pray you, sir, what is he? He is knight dubbed with unhatched rapier, and on carpet consideration; but he is a devil in private brawl: souls and bodies hath he divorced three, and his incensement at this moment is so implacable that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death and sepulchre. Hob, nob, is his word: give't or take't. I will return again into the house and desire some conduct of the lady: I am no fighter. I have heard of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on others to taste their valour; belike this is a man of that quirk. Sir, no; his indignation derives itself out of a very competent injury: therefore get you on and give him his desire. Back you shall not to the house, unless you undertake that with me which with as much safety you might answer him: therefore, on, or strip your sword stark naked; for meddle you must, that's certain, or forswear to wear iron about you. This is as uncivil as strange. I beseech you, do me this courteous office, as to know of the knight what my offence to him is: it is something of my negligence, nothing of my purpose. I will do so. Signior Fabian, stay you by this gentleman till my return. Pray you, sir, do you know of this matter? I know the knight is incensed against you, even to a mortal arbitrement, but nothing of the circumstance more. I beseech you, what manner of man is he? Nothing of that wonderful promise, to read him by his form, as you are like to find him in the proof of his valour. He is, indeed, sir, the most skilful, bloody, and fatal opposite that you could possibly have found in any part of Illyria. Will you walk towards him? I will make your peace with him if I can. I shall be much bound to you for't: I am one that had rather go with sir priest than sir knight; I care not who knows so much of my mettle. Why, man, he's a very devil; I have not seen such a firago. I had a pass with him, rapier, scabbard and all, and he gives me the stuck in with such a mortal motion that it is inevitable; and on the answer, he pays you as surely as your feet hit the ground they step on. They say he has been fencer to the Sophy. Pox on't, I'll not meddle with him. Ay, but he will not now be pacified: Fabian can scarce hold him yonder. Plague on't; an I thought he had been valiant and so cunning in fence I'd have seen him damned ere I'd have challenged him. Let him let the matter slip, and I'll give him my horse, grey Capilet. I'll make the motion. Stand here; make a good show on't: this shall end without the perdition of souls.â€” Marry, I'll ride your horse as well as I ride you. I have his horse to take up the quarrel. I have persuaded him the youth's a devil. He is as horribly conceited of him; and pants and looks pale, as if a bear were at his heels. There's no remedy, sir: he will fight with you for his oath's sake. Marry, he hath better bethought him of his quarrel, and he finds that now scarce to be worth talking of: therefore draw for the supportance of his vow: he protests he will not hurt you. Pray God defend me! A little thing would make me tell them how much I lack of a man. Give ground, if you see him furious. Come, Sir Andrew, there's no remedy: the gentleman will, for his honour's sake, have one bout with you; he cannot by the duello avoid it: but he has promised me, as he is a gentleman and a soldier, he will not hurt you. Come on; to't. Pray God, he keep his oath! I do assure you, 'tis against my will. Put up your sword. If this young gentleman Have done offence, I take the fault on me: If you offend him, I for him defy you. You, sir! why, what are you? One, sir, that for his love dares yet do more Than you have heard him brag to you he will. Nay, if you be an undertaker, I am for you. O, good sir Toby, hold! here come the officers. I'll be with you anon. Pray, sir, put your sword up, if you please. Marry, will I, sir; and, for that I promised you, I'll be as good as my word. He will bear you easily and reins well. This is the man; do thy office. Antonio, I arrest thee at the suit Of Count Orsino. You do mistake me, sir. No, sir, no jot: I know your favour well, Though now you have no sea-cap on your head. Take him away: he knows I know him well. I must obey.â€” This comes with seeking you: But there's no remedy: I shall answer it. What will you do, now my necessity Makes me to ask you for my purse? It grieves me Much more for what I cannot do for you Than what befalls myself. You stand amaz'd: But be of comfort. Come, sir, away. I must entreat of you some of that money. What money, sir? For the fair kindness you have show'd me here, And part, being prompted by your present trouble, Out of my lean and low ability I'll lend you something: my having is not much: I'll make division of my present with you. Hold, there is half my coffer. Will you deny me now? Is't possible that my deserts to you Can lack persuasion? Do not tempt my misery, Lest that it make me so unsound a man As to upbraid you with those kindnesses That I have done for you. I know of none; Nor know I you by voice or any feature. I hate ingratitude more in a man Than lying, vainness, babbling drunkenness, Or any taint of vice whose strong corruption Inhabits our frail blood. O heavens themselves! Come, sir: I pray you, go. Let me speak a little. This youth that you see here I snatch'd one-half out of the jaws of death, Reliev'd him with such sanctity of love, And to his image, which methought did promise Most venerable worth, did I devotion. What's that to us? The time goes by: away! But O! how vile an idol proves this god. Thou hast, Sebastian, done good feature shame. In nature there's no blemish but the mind; None can be call'd deform'd but the unkind: Virtue is beauty, but the beauteous evil Are empty trunks o'erflourish'd by the devil. The man grows mad: away with him! Come, come, sir. Lead me on. Methinks his words do from such passion fly, That he believes himself; so do not I. Prove true, imagination, O, prove true, That I, dear brother, be now ta'en for you! Come hither, knight; come hither, Fabian: we'll whisper o'er a couplet or two of most sage saws. He nam'd Sebastian: I my brother know Yet living in my glass; even such and so In favour was my brother; and he went Still in this fashion, colour, ornament, For him I imitate. O! if it prove, Tempests are kind, and salt waves fresh in love! A very dishonest paltry boy, and more a coward than a hare. His dishonesty appears in leaving his friend here in necessity, and denying him; and for his cowardship, ask Fabian. A coward, a most devout coward, religious in it. 'Slid, I'll after him again and beat him. Do; cuff him soundly, but never draw thy sword. An I do not,â€” Come, let's see the event. I dare lay any money 'twill be nothing yet. Will you make me believe that I am not sent for you? Go to, go to; thou art a foolish fellow: Let me be clear of thee. Well held out, i' faith! No, I do not know you; nor I am not sent to you by my lady to bid you come speak with her; nor your name is not Master Cesario; nor this is not my nose neither. Nothing that is so is so. I prithee, vent thy folly somewhere else: Thou know'st not me. Vent my folly! He has heard that word of some great man, and now applies it to a fool. Vent my folly! I am afraid this great lubber, the world, will prove a cockney. I prithee now, ungird thy strangeness and tell me what I shall vent to my lady. Shall I vent to her that thou art coming? I prithee, foolish Greek, depart from me: There's money for thee: if you tarry longer I shall give worse payment. By my troth, thou hast an open hand. These wise men that give fools money get themselves a good report after fourteen years' purchase. Now, sir, have I met you again? there's for you. Why, there's for thee, and there, and there, and there! Are all the people mad? Hold, sir, or I'll throw your dagger o'er the house. This will I tell my lady straight. I would not be in some of your coats for twopence. Come on, sir: hold. Nay, let him alone; I'll go another way to work with him: I'll have an action of battery against him if there be any law in Illyria. Though I struck him first, yet it's no matter for that. Let go thy hand. Come, sir, I will not let you go. Come, my young soldier, put up your iron: you are well fleshed; come on. I will be free from thee. What wouldst thou now? If thou dar'st tempt me further, draw thy sword. What, what! Nay then, I must have an ounce or two of this malapert blood from you. Hold, Toby! on thy life I charge thee, hold! Madam! Will it be ever thus? Ungracious wretch! Fit for the mountains and the barbarous caves, Where manners ne'er were preach'd. Out of my sight! Be not offended, dear Cesario. Rudesby, be gone! I prithee, gentle friend, Let thy fair wisdom, not thy passion, sway In this uncivil and unjust extent Against thy peace. Go with me to my house, And hear thou there how many fruitless pranks This ruffian hath botch'd up, that thou thereby Mayst smile at this. Thou shalt not choose but go: Do not deny. Beshrew his soul for me, He started one poor heart of mine in thee. What relish is in this? how runs the stream? Or I am mad, or else this is a dream: Let fancy still my sense in Lethe steep; If it be thus to dream, still let me sleep! Nay; come, I prithee. Would thou'dst be rul'd by me! Madam, I will. O! say so, and so be! Nay, I prithee, put on this gown and this beard; make him believe thou art Sir Topas the curate: do it quickly; I'll call Sir Toby the whilst. Well, I'll put it on and I will dissemble myself in't: and I would I were the first that ever dissembled in such a gown. I am not tall enough to become the function well, nor lean enough to be thought a good student; but to be said an honest man and a good housekeeper goes as fairly as to say a careful man and a great scholar. The competitors enter. God bless thee, Master parson. Bonos dies, Sir Toby: for, as the old hermit of Prague, that never saw pen and ink, very wittily said to a niece of King Gorboduc, 'That, that is, is;' so I, being Master parson, am Master parson; for, what is 'that,' but 'that,' and 'is,' but 'is?' To him, Sir Topas. What ho! I say. Peace in this prison! The knave counterfeits well; a good knave. Who calls there? Sir Topas, the curate, who comes to visit Malvolio the lunatic. Sir Topas, Sir Topas, good Sir Topas, go to my lady. Out, hyperbolical fiend! how vexest thou this man! Talkest thou nothing but of ladies? Well said, Master Parson. Sir Topas, never was man thus wronged. Good Sir Topas, do not think I am mad: they have laid me here in hideous darkness. Fie, thou dishonest Satan! I call thee by the most modest terms; for I am one of those gentle ones that will use the devil himself with courtesy. Sayst thou that house is dark? As hell, Sir Topas. Why, it hath bay-windows transparent as barricadoes, and the clerestories toward the south-north are as lustrous as ebony; and yet complainest thou of obstruction? I am not mad, Sir Topas. I say to you, this house is dark. Madman, thou errest: I say, there is no darkness but ignorance, in which thou art more puzzled than the Egyptians in their fog. I say this house is as dark as ignorance, though ignorance were as dark as hell; and I say, there was never man thus abused. I am no more mad than you are: make the trial of it in any constant question. What is the opinion of Pythagoras concerning wild fowl? That the soul of our grandam might haply inhabit a bird. What thinkest thou of his opinion? I think nobly of the soul, and no way approve his opinion. Fare thee well: remain thou still in darkness: thou shalt hold the opinion of Pythagoras ere I will allow of thy wits, and fear to kill a woodcock, lest thou dispossess the soul of thy grandam. Fare thee well. Sir Topas! Sir Topas! My most exquisite Sir Topas! Nay, I am for all waters. Thou mightst have done this without thy beard and gown: he sees thee not. To him in thine own voice, and bring me word how thou findest him: I would we were well rid of this knavery. If he may be conveniently delivered, I would he were; for I am now so far in offence with my niece that I cannot pursue with any safety this sport to the upshot. Come by and by to my chamber. Hey Robin, jolly Robin, Tell me how thy lady does. Fool! My lady is unkind, perdy! Fool! Alas, why is she so? Fool, I say! She loves another. Who calls, ha? Good fool, as ever thou wilt deserve well at my hand, help me to a candle, and pen, ink, and paper. As I am a gentleman, I will live to be thankful to thee for't. Master Malvoliol Ay, good fool. Alas, sir, how fell you beside your five wits? Fool, there was never man so notoriously abused: I am as well in my wits, fool, as thou art. But as well? then you are mad indeed, if you be no better in your wits than a fool. They have here propertied me; keep me in darkness, send ministers to me, asses! and do all they can to face me out of my wits. Advise you what you say: the minister is here. Malvolio, Malvolio, thy wits the heavens restore! endeavour thyself to sleep, and leave thy vain bibble-babble. Sir Topas! Maintain no words with him, good fellow.â€”Who, I, sir? not I, sir. God be wi' you, good Sir Topas. Marry, amen. I will, sir, I will. Fool, fool, fool, I say! Alas, sir, be patient. What say you, sir? I am shent for speaking to you. Good fool, help me to some light and some paper: I tell thee I am as well in my wits as any man in Illyria. Well-a-day, that you were, sir! By this hand, I am. Good fool, some ink, paper, and light; and convey what I will set down to my lady: it shall advantage thee more than ever the bearing of letter did. I will help you to't. But tell me true, are you not mad indeed? or do you but counterfeit? Believe me, I am not: I tell thee true. Nay, I'll ne'er believe a madman till I see his brains. I will fetch you light and paper and ink. Fool, I'll requite it in the highest degree: I prithee, be gone. I am gone, sir, And anon, sir, I'll be with you again In a trice, Like to the old Vice, Your need to sustain; Who with dagger of lath, In his rage and his wrath, Cries, Ah, ah! to the devil: Like a mad lad, Pare thy nails, dad; Adieu, goodman drivel. This is the air; that is the glorious sun; This pearl she gave me, I do feel't and see't; And though 'tis wonder that enwraps me thus, Yet 'tis not madness. Where's Antonio then? I could not find him at the Elephant; Yet there he was, and there I found this credit, That he did range the town to seek me out. His counsel now might do me golden service; For though my soul disputes well with my sense That this may be some error, but no madness, Yet doth this accident and flood of fortune So far exceed all instance, all discourse, That I am ready to distrust mine eyes, And wrangle with my reason that persuades me To any other trust but that I am mad Or else the lady's mad: yet, if 'twere so, She could not sway her house, command her followers, Take and give back affairs and their dispatch With such a smooth, discreet, and stable bearing As I perceive she does. There's something in't That is deceivable. But here the lady comes. Blame not this haste of mine. If you mean well, Now go with me and with this holy man Into the chantry by; there, before him, And underneath that consecrated roof, Plight me the full assurance of your faith; That my most jealous and too doubtful soul May live at peace. He shall conceal it Whiles you are willing it shall come to note, What time we will our celebration keep According to my birth. What do you say? I'll follow this good man, and go with you; And, having sworn truth, ever will be true. Then lead the way, good father; and heavens so shine That they may fairly note this act of mine! Now, as thou lovest me, let me see his letter. Good Master Fabian, grant me another request. Anything. Do not desire to see this letter. This is, to give a dog, and, in recompense desire my dog again. Belong you to the Lady Olivia, friends? Ay, sir; we are some of her trappings. I know thee well: how dost thou, my good fellow? Truly, sir, the better for my foes and the worse for my friends. Just the contrary; the better for thy friends. No, sir, the worse. How can that be? Marry, sir, they praise me and make an ass of me; now my foes tell me plainly I am an ass: so that by my foes, sir, I profit in the knowledge of myself, and by my friends I am abused: so that, conclusions to be as kisses, if your four negatives make your two affirmatives, why then, the worse for my friends and the better for my foes. Why, this is excellent. By my troth, sir, no; though it please you to be one of my friends. Thou shalt not be the worse for me: there's gold. But that it would be double-dealing, sir, I would you could make it another. O, you give me ill counsel. Put your grace in your pocket, sir, for this once, and let your flesh and blood obey it. Well, I will be so much a sinner to be a double-dealer: there's another. Primo, secundo, tertio, is a good play; and the old saying is, 'the third pays for all:' the triplex, sir, is a good tripping measure; or the bells of Saint Bennet, sir, may put you in mind; one, two, three. You can fool no more money out of me at this throw: if you will let your lady know I am here to speak with her, and bring her along with you, it may awake my bounty further. Marry, sir, lullaby to your bounty till I come again. I go, sir; but I would not have you to think that my desire of having is the sin of covetousness; but as you say, sir, let your bounty take a nap, I will awake it anon. Here comes the man, sir, that did rescue me. That face of his I do remember well; Yet when I saw it last, it was besmear'd As black as Vulcan in the smoke of war. A bawbling vessel was he captain of, For shallow draught and hulk unprizable; With which such scathful grapple did he make With the most noble bottom of our fleet, That very envy and the tongue of loss Cried fame and honour on him. What's the matter? Orsino, this is that Antonio That took the PhÅ“nix and her fraught from Candy; And this is he that did the Tiger board, When your young nephew Titus lost his leg. Here in the streets, desperate of shame and state, In private brabble did we apprehend him. He did me kindness, sir, drew on my side; But in conclusion put strange speech upon me: I know not what 'twas but distraction. Notable pirate! thou salt-water thief! What foolish boldness brought thee to their mercies Whom thou, in terms so bloody and so dear, Hast made thine enemies? Orsino, noble sir, Be pleas'd that I shake off these names you give me: Antonio never yet was thief or pirate, Though I confess, on base and ground enough, Orsino's enemy. A witchcraft drew me hither: That most ingrateful boy there by your side, From the rude sea's enrag'd and foamy mouth Did I redeem; a wrack past hope he was: His life I gave him, and did thereto add My love, without retention or restraint, All his in dedication; for his sake Did I expose myself, pure for his love, Into the danger of this adverse town; Drew to defend him when he was beset: Where being apprehended, his false cunning, Not meaning to partake with me in danger, Taught him to face me out of his acquaintance, And grew a twenty years removed thing While one would wink, denied me mine own purse, Which I had recommended to his use Not half an hour before. How can this be? When came he to this town? To-day, my lord; and for three months before,â€” No interim, not a minute's vacancy,â€” Both day and night did we keep company. Here comes the countess: now heaven walks on earth! But for thee, fellow; fellow, thy words are madness: Three months this youth hath tended upon me; But more of that anon. Take him aside. What would my lord, but that he may not have, Wherein Olivia may seem serviceable? Cesario, you do not keep promise with me. Madam! Gracious Olivia.â€” What do you say, Cesario? Good my lord,â€” My lord would speak; my duty hushes me. If it be aught to the old tune, my lord, It is as fat and fulsome to mine ear As howling after music. Still so cruel? Still so constant, lord. What, to perverseness? you uncivil lady, To whose ingrate and unauspicious altars My soul the faithfull'st offerings hath breath'd out That e'er devotion tender'd! What shall I do? Even what it please my lord, that shall become him. Why should I not, had I the heart to do it, Like to the Egyptian thief at point of death, Kill what I love? a savage jealousy That sometimes savours nobly. But hear me this: Since you to non-regardance cast my faith, And that I partly know the instrument That screws me from my true place in your favour, Live you, the marble-breasted tyrant still; But this your minion, whom I know you love, And whom, by heaven I swear, I tender dearly, Him will I tear out of that cruel eye, Where he sits crowned in his master's spite. Come, boy, with me; my thoughts are ripe in mischief; I'll sacrifice the lamb that I do love, To spite a raven's heart within a dove. And I, most jocund, apt, and willingly, To do you rest, a thousand deaths would die. Where goes Cesario? After him I love More than I love these eyes, more than my life, More, by all mores, than e'er I shall love wife. If I do feign, you witnesses above Punish my life for tainting of my love! Ah me, detested! how am I beguil'd! Who does beguile you? who does do you wrong? Hast thou forgot thyself? Is it so long? Call forth the holy father. Come away. Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay. Husband? Ay, husband: can he that deny? Her husband, sirrah? No, my lord, not I. Alas! it is the baseness of thy fear That makes thee strangle thy propriety. Fear not, Cesario; take thy fortunes up; Be that thou know'st thou art, and then thou art As great as that thou fear'st. O, welcome, father! Father, I charge thee, by thy reverence, Here to unfold,â€”though lately we intended To keep in darkness what occasion now Reveals before 'tis ripe,â€”what thou dost know Hath newly pass'd between this youth and me. A contract of eternal bond of love, Confirm'd by mutual joinder of your hands, Attested by the holy close of lips, Strengthen'd by interchangement of your rings; And all the ceremony of this compact Seal'd in my function, by my testimony: Since when, my watch hath told me, toward my grave I have travell'd but two hours. O, thou dissembling cub! what wilt thou be When time hath sow'd a grizzle on thy case? Or will not else thy craft so quickly grow That thine own trip shall be thine overthrow? Farewell, and take her; but direct thy feet Where thou and I henceforth may never meet. My lord, I do protest,â€” O! do not swear: Hold little faith, though thou hast too much fear. For the love of God, a surgeon! send one presently to Sir Toby. What's the matter? He has broke my head across, and has given Sir Toby a bloody coxcomb too. For the love of God, your help! I had rather than forty pound I were at home. Who has done this, Sir Andrew? The count's gentleman, one Cesario: we took him for a coward, but he's the very devil incardinate. My gentleman, Cesario? Od's lifelings! here he is. You broke my head for nothing! and that that I did, I was set on to do't by Sir Toby. Why do you speak to me? I never hurt you: You drew your sword upon me without cause; But I bespake you fair, and hurt you not. If a bloody coxcomb be a hurt, you have hurt me: I think you set nothing by a bloody coxcomb. Here comes Sir Toby halting; you shall hear more: but if he had not been in drink he would have tickled you othergates than he did. How now, gentleman! how is't with you? That's all one: he has hurt me, and there's the end on't. Sot, didst see Dick surgeon, sot? O! he's drunk, Sir Toby, an hour agone: his eyes were set at eight i' the morning. Then he's a rogue, and a passy-measures pavin. I hate a drunken rogue. Away with him! Who hath made this havoc with them? I'll help you, Sir Toby, because we'll be dressed together. Will you help? an ass-head and a coxcomb and a knave, a thin-faced knave, a gull! Get him to bed, and let his hurt be look'd to. I am sorry, madam, I have hurt your kinsman; But, had it been the brother of my blood, I must have done no less with wit and safety. You throw a strange regard upon me, and by that I do perceive it hath offended you: Pardon me, sweet one, even for the vows We made each other but so late ago. One face, one voice, one habit, and two persons; A natural perspective, that is, and is not! Antonio! O my dear Antonio! How have the hours rack'd and tortur'd me Since I have lost thee! Sebastian are you? Fear'st thou that, Antonio? How have you made division of yourself? An apple cleft in two is not more twin Than these two creatures. Which is Sebastian? Most wonderful! Do I stand there? I never had a brother; Nor can there be that deity in my nature, Of here and every where. I had a sister, Whom the blind waves and surges have devour'd. Of charity, what kin are you to me? What countryman? what name? what parentage? Of Messaline: Sebastian was my father; Such a Sebastian was my brother too, So went he suited to his watery tomb. If spirits can assume both form and suit You come to fright us. A spirit I am indeed; But am in that dimension grossly clad Which from the womb I did participate. Were you a woman, as the rest goes even, I should my tears let fall upon your cheek, And say, 'Thrice welcome, drowned Viola!' My father had a mole upon his brow. And so had mine. And died that day when Viola from her birth Had number'd thirteen years. O! that record is lively in my soul. He finished indeed his mortal act That day that made my sister thirteen years. If nothing lets to make us happy both But this my masculine usurp'd attire, Do not embrace me till each circumstance Of place, time, fortune, do cohere and jump That I am Viola: which to confirm, I'll bring you to a captain in this town, Where lie my maiden weeds: by whose gentle help I was preserv'd to serve this noble count. All the occurrence of my fortune since Hath been between this lady and this lord. So comes it, lady, you have been mistook: But nature to her bias drew in that. You would have been contracted to a maid; Nor are you therein, by my life, deceiv'd, You are betroth'd both to a maid and man. Be not amaz'd; right noble is his blood. If this be so, as yet the glass seems true, I shall have share in this most happy wrack. Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times Thou never shouldst love woman like to me. And all those sayings will I over-swear, And all those swearings keep as true in soul As doth that orbed continent the fire That severs day from night. Give me thy hand; And let me see thee in thy woman's weeds. The captain that did bring me first on shore Hath my maid's garments: he upon some action Is now in durance at Malvolio's suit, A gentleman and follower of my lady's. He shall enlarge him. Fetch Malvolio hither. And yet, alas, now I remember me, They say, poor gentleman, he's much distract. A most extracting frenzy of mine own From my remembrance clearly banish'd his. How does he, sirrah? Truly, madam, he holds Belzebub at the stave's end as well as a man in his case may do. He has here writ a letter to you: I should have given it to you to-day morning; but as a madman's epistles are no gospels, so it skills not much when they are delivered. Open it, and read it. Look then to be well edified, when the fool delivers the madman. By the Lord, madam,â€” How now! art thou mad? No, madam, I do but read madness: an your ladyship will have it as it ought to be, you must allow vox. Prithee, read i' thy right wits. So I do, madonna; but to read his right wits is to read thus: therefore perpend, my princess, and give ear. Read it you, sirrah. By the Lord, madam, you wrong me, and the world shall know it: though you have put me into darkness, and given your drunken cousin rule over me, yet have I the benefit of my senses as well as your ladyship. I have your own letter that induced me to the semblance I put on; with the which I doubt not but to do myself much right, or you much shame. Think of me as you please. I leave my duty a little unthought of, and speak out of my injury. THE MADLY-USED MALVOLIO. Did he write this? Ay, madam. This savours not much of distraction. See him deliver'd, Fabian; bring him hither. My lord, so please you, these things further thought on, To think me as well a sister as a wife, One day shall crown the alliance on't, so please you, Here at my house and at my proper cost. Madam, I am most apt to embrace your offer. Your master quits you; and, for your service done him, So much against the mettle of your sex, So far beneath your soft and tender breeding; And since you call'd me master for so long, Here is my hand: you shall from this time be Your master's mistress. A sister! you are she. Is this the madman? Ay, my lord, this same. How now, Malvolio! Madam, you have done me wrong, Notorious wrong. Have I, Malvolio? no. Lady, you have. Pray you peruse that letter. You must not now deny it is your hand: Write from it, if you can, in hand or phrase, Or say 'tis not your seal nor your invention: You can say none of this. Well, grant it then, And tell me, in the modesty of honour, Why you have given me such clear lights of favour, Bade me come smiling and cross-garter'd to you, To put on yellow stockings, and to frown Upon Sir Toby and the lighter people; And, acting this in an obedient hope, Why have you suffer'd me to be imprison'd, Kept in a dark house, visited by the priest, And made the most notorious geck and gull That e'er invention play'd on? tell me why. Alas! Malvolio, this is not my writing, Though, I confess, much like the character; But, out of question, 'tis Maria's hand: And now I do bethink me, it was she First told me thou wast mad; then cam'st in smiling, And in such forms which here were presuppos'd Upon thee in the letter. Prithee, be content: This practice hath most shrewdly pass'd upon thee; But when we know the grounds and authors of it, Thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge Of thine own cause. Good madam, hear me speak, And let no quarrel nor no brawl to come Taint the condition of this present hour, Which I have wonder'd at. In hope it shall not, Most freely I confess, myself and Toby Set this device against Malvolio here, Upon some stubborn and uncourteous parts We had conceiv'd against him. Maria writ The letter at Sir Toby's great importance; In recompense whereof he hath married her. How with a sportful malice it was follow'd, May rather pluck on laughter than revenge, If that the injuries be justly weigh'd That have on both sides past. Alas, poor fool, how have they baffled thee! Why, 'some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrown upon them.' I was one, sir, in this interlude; one Sir Topas, sir; but that's all one. 'By the Lord, fool, I am not mad:' But do you remember? 'Madam, why laugh you at such a barren rascal? an you smile not, he's gagged:' and thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges. I'll be reveng'd on the whole pack of you. He hath been most notoriously abus'd. Pursue him, and entreat him to a peace;â€” He hath not told us of the captain yet: When that is known and golden time convents, A solemn combination shall be made Of our dear souls. Meantime, sweet sister, We will not part from hence. Cesario, come; For so you shall be, while you are a man; But when in other habits you are seen, Orsino's mistress, and his fancy's queen. When that I was and a little tiny boy, With hey, ho, the wind and the rain; A foolish thing was but a toy, For the rain it raineth every day. But when I came to man's estate, With hey, ho, the wind and the rain; 'Gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gates, For the rain it raineth every day. But when I came, alas! to wive, With hey, ho, the wind and the rain; By swaggering could I never thrive, For the rain it raineth every day. But when I came unto my beds, With hey, ho, the wind and the rain; With toss-pots still had drunken heads, For the rain it raineth every day. A great while ago the world begun, With hey, ho, the wind and the rain; But that's all one, our play is done, And we'll strive to please you every day.\n"

      "In sooth, I know not why I am so sad: It wearies me; you say it wearies you; But how I caught it, found it, or came by it, What stuff 'tis made of, whereof it is born, I am to learn; And such a want-wit sadness makes of me, That I have much ado to know myself. Your mind is tossing on the ocean; There, where your argosies with portly sail,â€” Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood, Or, as it were, the pageants of the sea,â€” Do overpeer the petty traffickers, That curtsy to them, do them reverence, As they fly by them with their woven wings. Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth, The better part of my affections would Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still Plucking the grass to know where sits the wind; Peering in maps for ports, and piers, and roads; And every object that might make me fear Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt Would make me sad. My wind, cooling my broth, Would blow me to an ague, when I thought What harm a wind too great might do at sea. I should not see the sandy hour-glass run But I should think of shallows and of flats, And see my wealthy Andrew dock'd in sand Vailing her high-top lower than her ribs To kiss her burial. Should I go to church And see the holy edifice of stone, And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks, Which touching but my gentle vessel's side Would scatter all her spices on the stream, Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks; And, in a word, but even now worth this, And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought To think on this, and shall I lack the thought That such a thing bechanc'd would make me sad? But tell not me: I know Antonio Is sad to think upon his merchandise. Believe me, no: I thank my fortune for it, My ventures are not in one bottom trusted, Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate Upon the fortune of this present year: Therefore, my merchandise makes me not sad. Why, then you are in love. Fie, fie! Not in love neither? Then let's say you are sad, Because you are not merry: and 'twere as easy For you to laugh and leap, and say you are merry, Because you are not sad. Now, by two-headed Janus, Nature hath fram'd strange fellows in her time: Some that will evermore peep through their eyes And laugh like parrots at a bag-piper, And other of such vinegar aspect That they'll not show their teeth in way of smile, Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable. Here comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman, Gratiano, and Lorenzo. Fare ye well: We leave you now with better company. I would have stay'd till I had made you merry, If worthier friends had not prevented me. Your worth is very dear in my regard. I take it, your own business calls on you, And you embrace the occasion to depart. Good morrow, my good lords. Good signiors both, when shall we laugh? say when? You grow exceeding strange: must it be so? We'll make our leisures to attend on yours. My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio, We too will leave you; but, at dinner-time, I pray you, have in mind where we must meet. I will not fail you. You look not well, Signior Antonio; You have too much respect upon the world: They lose it that do buy it with much care: Believe me, you are marvellously chang'd. I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano; A stage where every man must play a part, And mine a sad one. Let me play the fool: With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come, And let my liver rather heat with wine Than my heart cool with mortifying groans. Why should a man, whose blood is warm within, Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster? Sleep when he wakes, and creep into the jaundice By being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonioâ€” I love thee, and it is my love that speaksâ€” There are a sort of men whose visages Do cream and mantle like a standing pond, And do a wilful stillness entertain, With purpose to be dress'd in an opinion Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit; As who should say, 'I am Sir Oracle, And when I ope my lips let no dog bark!' O, my Antonio, I do know of these, That therefore only are reputed wise For saying nothing; when, I am very sure, If they should speak, would almost damn those ears Which, hearing them, would call their brothers fools. I'll tell thee more of this another time: But fish not, with this melancholy bait, For this fool-gudgeon, this opinion. Come, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well awhile: I'll end my exhortation after dinner. Well, we will leave you then till dinner-time. I must be one of these same dumb-wise men, For Gratiano never lets me speak. Well, keep me company but two years moe, Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue. Farewell: I'll grow a talker for this gear. Thanks, i' faith; for silence is only commendable In a neat's tongue dried and a maid not vendible. Is that anything now? Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more than any man in all Venice. His reasons are as two grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff: you shall seek all day ere you find them, and, when you have them, they are not worth the search. Well, tell me now, what lady is the same To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage, That you to-day promis'd to tell me of? 'Tis not unknown to you, Antonio, How much I have disabled mine estate, By something showing a more swelling port Than my faint means would grant continuance: Nor do I now make moan to be abridg'd From such a noble rate; but my chief care Is, to come fairly off from the great debts Wherein my time, something too prodigal, Hath left me gag'd. To you, Antonio, I owe the most, in money and in love; And from your love I have a warranty To unburthen all my plots and purposes How to get clear of all the debts I owe. I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it; And if it stand, as you yourself still do, Within the eye of honour, be assur'd, My purse, my person, my extremest means, Lie all unlock'd to your occasions. In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft, I shot his fellow of the self-same flight The self-same way with more advised watch, To find the other forth, and by adventuring both, I oft found both. I urge this childhood proof, Because what follows is pure innocence. I owe you much, and, like a wilful youth, That which I owe is lost; but if you please To shoot another arrow that self way Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt, As I will watch the aim, or to find both, Or bring your latter hazard back again, And thankfully rest debtor for the first. You know me well, and herein spend but time To wind about my love with circumstance; And out of doubt you do me now more wrong In making question of my uttermost Than if you had made waste of all I have: Then do but say to me what I should do That in your knowledge may by me be done, And I am prest unto it: therefore speak. In Belmont is a lady richly left, And she is fair, and, fairer than that word, Of wondrous virtues: sometimes from her eyes I did receive fair speechless messages: Her name is Portia; nothing undervalu'd To Cato's daughter, Brutus' Portia: Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth, For the four winds blow in from every coast Renowned suitors; and her sunny locks Hang on her temples like a golden fleece; Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos' strond, And many Jasons come in quest of her. O my Antonio! had I but the means To hold a rival place with one of them, I have a mind presages me such thrift, That I should questionless be fortunate. Thou knowest that all my fortunes are at sea; Neither have I money, nor commodity To raise a present sum: therefore go forth; Try what my credit can in Venice do: That shall be rack'd, even to the uttermost, To furnish thee to Belmont, to fair Portia. Go, presently inquire, and so will I, Where money is, and I no question make To have it of my trust or for my sake. By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of this great world. You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in the same abundance as your good fortunes are: and yet, for aught I see, they are as sick that surfeit with too much as they that starve with nothing. It is no mean happiness therefore, to be seated in the mean: superfluity comes sooner by white hairs, but competency lives longer. Good sentences and well pronounced. They would be better if well followed. If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do, chapels had been churches, and poor men's cottages princes' palaces. It is a good divine that follows his own instructions: I can easier teach twenty what were good to be done, than be one of the twenty to follow mine own teaching. The brain may devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps o'er a cold decree: such a hare is madness the youth, to skip o'er the meshes of good counsel the cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a husband. O me, the word 'choose!' I may neither choose whom I would nor refuse whom I dislike; so is the will of a living daughter curbed by the will of a dead father. Is it not hard, Nerissa, that I cannot choose one nor refuse none? Your father was ever virtuous, and holy men at their death have good inspirations; therefore, the lottery that he hath devised in these three chests of gold, silver, and lead, whereof who chooses his meaning chooses you, will, no doubt, never be chosen by any rightly but one who you shall rightly love. But what warmth is there in your affection towards any of these princely suitors that are already come? I pray thee, over-name them, and as thou namest them, I will describe them; and, according to my description, level at my affection. First, there is the Neapolitan prince. Ay, that's a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but talk of his horse; and he makes it a great appropriation to his own good parts that he can shoe him himself. I am much afeard my lady his mother played false with a smith. Then is there the County Palatine. He doth nothing but frown, as who should say, 'An you will not have me, choose.' He hears merry tales, and smiles not: I fear he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old, being so full of unmannerly sadness in his youth. I had rather be married to a death's-head with a bone in his mouth than to either of these. God defend me from these two! How say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon? God made him, and therefore let him pass for a man. In truth, I know it is a sin to be a mocker; but, he! why, he hath a horse better than the Neapolitan's, a better bad habit of frowning than the Count Palatine; he is every man in no man; if a throstle sing, he falls straight a-capering; he will fence with his own shadow: if I should marry him, I should marry twenty husbands. If he would despise me, I would forgive him, for if he love me to madness, I shall never requite him. What say you, then, to Falconbridge, the young baron of England? You know I say nothing to him, for he understands not me, nor I him: he hath neither Latin, French, nor Italian; and you will come into the court and swear that I have a poor pennyworth in the English. He is a proper man's picture, but, alas! who can converse with a dumb-show? How oddly he is suited! I think he bought his doublet in Italy, his round hose in France, his bonnet in Germany, and his behaviour every where. What think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbour? That he hath a neighbourly charity in him, for he borrowed a box of the ear of the Englishman, and swore he would pay him again when he was able: I think the Frenchman became his surety and sealed under for another. How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony's nephew? Very vilely in the morning, when he is sober, and most vilely in the afternoon, when he is drunk: when he is best, he is a little worse than a man, and when he is worst, he is little better than a beast. An the worst fall that ever fell, I hope I shall make shift to go without him. If he should offer to choose, and choose the right casket, you should refuse to perform your father's will, if you should refuse to accept him. Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee, set a deep glass of Rhenish wine on the contrary casket, for, if the devil be within and that temptation without, I know he will choose it. I will do anything, Nerissa, ere I will be married to a sponge. You need not fear, lady, the having any of these lords: they have acquainted me with their determinations; which is, indeed, to return to their home and to trouble you with no more suit, unless you may be won by some other sort than your father's imposition depending on the caskets. If I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as chaste as Diana, unless I be obtained by the manner of my father's will. I am glad this parcel of wooers are so reasonable, for there is not one among them but I dote on his very absence, and I pray God grant them a fair departure. Do you not remember, lady, in your father's time, a Venetian, a scholar and a soldier, that came hither in the company of the Marquis of Montferrat? Yes, yes: it was Bassanio; as I think, he was so called. True, madam: he, of all the men that ever my foolish eyes looked upon, was the best deserving a fair lady. I remember him well, and I remember him worthy of thy praise. How now! what news? The four strangers seek for you, madam, to take their leave; and there is a forerunner come from a fifth, the Prince of Morocco, who brings word the prince his master will be here to-night. If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good heart as I can bid the other four farewell, I should be glad of his approach: if he have the condition of a saint and the complexion of a devil, I had rather he should shrive me than wive me. Come, Nerissa. Sirrah, go before. Whiles we shut the gate upon one wooer, another knocks at the door. Three thousand ducats; well? Ay, sir, for three months. For three months; well? For the which, as I told you, Antonio shall be bound. Antonio shall become bound; well? May you stead me? Will you pleasure me? Shall I know your answer? Three thousand ducats, for three months, and Antonio bound. Your answer to that. Antonio is a good man. Have you heard any imputation to the contrary? Ho, no, no, no, no: my meaning in saying he is a good man is to have you understand me that he is sufficient. Yet his means are in supposition: he hath an argosy bound to Tripolis, another to the Indies; I understand moreover upon the Rialto, he hath a third at Mexico, a fourth for England, and other ventures he hath, squandered abroad. But ships are but boards, sailors but men: there be land-rats and water-rats, land-thieves, and water-thieves,â€”I mean pirates,â€”and then there is the peril of waters, winds, and rocks. The man is, notwithstanding, sufficient. Three thousand ducats; I think, I may take his bond. Be assured you may. I will be assured I may; and, that I may be assured, I will bethink me. May I speak with Antonio? If it please you to dine with us. Yes, to smell pork: to eat of the habitation which your prophet the Nazarite conjured the devil into. I will buy with you, sell with you, talk with you, walk with you, and so following; but I will not eat with you, drink with you, nor pray with you. What news on the Rialto? Who is he comes here? This is Signior Antonio. How like a fawning publican he looks! I hate him for he is a Christian; But more for that in low simplicity He lends out money gratis, and brings down The rate of usance here with us in Venice. If I can catch him once upon the hip, I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him. He hates our sacred nation, and he rails, Even there where merchants most do congregate, On me, my bargains, and my well-won thrift, Which he calls interest. Cursed be my tribe, If I forgive him! Shylock, do you hear? I am debating of my present store, And, by the near guess of my memory, I cannot instantly raise up the gross Of full three thousand ducats. What of that? Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe, Will furnish me. But soft! how many months Do you desire? Rest you fair, good signior; Your worship was the last man in our mouths. Shylock, albeit I neither lend nor borrow By taking nor by giving of excess, Yet, to supply the ripe wants of my friend, I'll break a custom. Is he yet possess'd How much ye would? Ay, ay, three thousand ducats. And for three months. I had forgot; three months; you told me so. Well then, your bond; and let me see. But hear you; Methought you said you neither lend nor borrow Upon advantage. I do never use it. When Jacob graz'd his uncle Laban's sheep,â€” This Jacob from our holy Abram was, As his wise mother wrought in his behalf, The third possessor: ay, he was the third,â€” And what of him? did he take interest? No; not take interest; not, as you would say, Directly interest: mark what Jacob did. When Laban and himself were compromis'd, That all the eanlings that were streak'd and pied Should fall as Jacob's hire, the ewes, being rank, In end of autumn turned to the rams; And, when the work of generation was Between these woolly breeders in the act, The skilful shepherd peel'd me certain wands, And, in the doing of the deed of kind, He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes, Who, then conceiving, did in eaning time Fall parti-colour'd lambs, and those were Jacob's. This was a way to thrive, and he was blest: And thrift is blessing, if men steal it not. This was a venture, sir, that Jacob serv'd for; A thing not in his power to bring to pass, But sway'd and fashion'd by the hand of heaven. Was this inserted to make interest good? Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams? I cannot tell; I make it breed as fast: But note me, signior. Mark you this, Bassanio, The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose. An evil soul, producing holy witness, Is like a villain with a smiling cheek, A goodly apple rotten at the heart. O, what a goodly outside falsehood hath! Three thousand ducats; 'tis a good round sum. Three months from twelve, then let me see the rate. Well, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you? Signior Antonio, many a time and oft In the Rialto you have rated me About my moneys and my usances: Still have I borne it with a patient shrug, For sufferance is the badge of all our tribe. You call me misbeliever, cut-throat dog, And spet upon my Jewish gaberdine, And all for use of that which is mine own. Well then, it now appears you need my help: Go to then; you come to me, and you say, 'Shylock, we would have moneys:' you say so; You, that did void your rheum upon my beard, And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur Over your threshold: moneys is your suit. What should I say to you? Should I not say, 'Hath a dog money? Is it possible A cur can lend three thousand ducats?' or Shall I bend low, and in a bondman's key, With bated breath, and whispering humbleness, Say this:â€” 'Fair sir, you spet on me on Wednesday last; You spurn'd me such a day; another time You call'd me dog; and for these courtesies I'll lend you thus much moneys?' I am as like to call thee so again, To spet on thee again, to spurn thee too. If thou wilt lend this money, lend it not As to thy friends,â€”for when did friendship take A breed for barren metal of his friend?â€” But lend it rather to thine enemy; Who if he break, thou mayst with better face Exact the penalty. Why, look you, how you storm! I would be friends with you, and have your love, Forget the shames that you have stain'd me with, Supply your present wants, and take no doit Of usance for my moneys, and you'll not hear me: This is kind I offer. This were kindness. This kindness will I show. Go with me to a notary, seal me there Your single bond; and, in a merry sport, If you repay me not on such a day, In such a place, such sum or sums as are Express'd in the condition, let the forfeit Be nominated for an equal pound Of your fair flesh, to be cut off and taken In what part of your body pleaseth me. Content, i' faith: I'll seal to such a bond, And say there is much kindness in the Jew. You shall not seal to such a bond for me: I'll rather dwell in my necessity. Why, fear not, man; I will not forfeit it: Within these two months, that's a month before This bond expires, I do expect return Of thrice three times the value of this bond. O father Abram! what these Christians are, Whose own hard dealing teaches them suspect The thoughts of others. Pray you, tell me this; If he should break his day, what should I gain By the exaction of the forfeiture? A pound of man's flesh, taken from a man, Is not so estimable, profitable neither, As flesh of muttons, beefs, or goats. I say, To buy his favour, I extend this friendship: If he will take it, so; if not, adieu; And, for my love, I pray you wrong me not. Yes, Shylock, I will seal unto this bond. Then meet me forthwith at the notary's; Give him direction for this merry bond, And I will go and purse the ducats straight, See to my house, left in the fearful guard Of an unthrifty knave, and presently I will be with you. Hie thee, gentle Jew. This Hebrew will turn Christian: he grows kind. I like not fair terms and a villain's mind. Come on: in this there can be no dismay; My ships come home a month before the day. Mislike me not for my complexion, The shadow'd livery of the burnish'd sun, To whom I am a neighbour and near bred. Bring me the fairest creature northward born, Where PhÅ“bus' fire scarce thaws the icicles, And let us make incision for your love, To prove whose blood is reddest, his or mine. I tell thee, lady, this aspect of mine Hath fear'd the valiant: by my love, I swear The best regarded virgins of our clime Have lov'd it too: I would not change this hue, Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen. In terms of choice I am not solely led By nice direction of a maiden's eyes; Besides, the lottery of my destiny Bars me the right of voluntary choosing: But if my father had not scanted me And hedg'd me by his wit, to yield myself His wife who wins me by that means I told you, Yourself, renowned prince, then stood as fair As any comer I have look'd on yet For my affection. Even for that I thank you: Therefore, I pray you, lead me to the caskets To try my fortune. By this scimitar,â€” That slew the Sophy, and a Persian prince That won three fields of Sultan Solyman,â€” I would outstare the sternest eyes that look, Outbrave the heart most daring on the earth, Pluck the young sucking cubs from the she-bear, Yea, mock the lion when he roars for prey, To win thee, lady. But, alas the while! If Hercules and Lichas play at dice Which is the better man, the greater throw May turn by fortune from the weaker hand: So is Alcides beaten by his page; And so may I, blind fortune leading me, Miss that which one unworthier may attain, And die with grieving. You must take your chance; And either not attempt to choose at all, Or swear before you choose, if you choose wrong, Never to speak to lady afterward In way of marriage: therefore be advis'd. Nor will not: come, bring me unto my chance. First, forward to the temple: after dinner Your hazard shall be made. Good fortune then! To make me blest or cursed'st among men! Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from this Jew my master. The fiend is at mine elbow, and tempts me, saying to me, 'Gobbo, Launcelot Gobbo, good Launcelot,' or 'good Gobbo,' or 'good Launcelot Gobbo, use your legs, take the start, run away.' My conscience says, 'No; take heed, honest Launcelot; take heed, honest Gobbo;' or, as aforesaid, 'honest Launcelot Gobbo; do not run; scorn running with thy heels.' Well, the most courageous fiend bids me pack: 'Via!' says the fiend; 'away!' says the fiend; 'for the heavens, rouse up a brave mind,' says the fiend, 'and run.' Well, my conscience, hanging about the neck of my heart, says very wisely to me, 'My honest friend Launcelot, being an honest man's son,'â€”or rather an honest woman's son;â€”for, indeed, my father did something smack, something grow to, he had a kind of taste;â€”well, my conscience says, 'Launcelot, budge not.' 'Budge,' says the fiend. 'Budge not,' says my conscience. 'Conscience,' say I, 'you counsel well;' 'fiend,' say I, 'you counsel well:' to be ruled by my conscience, I should stay with the Jew my master, who, God bless the mark! is a kind of devil; and, to run away from the Jew, I should be ruled by the fiend, who, saving your reverence, is the devil himself. Certainly, the Jew is the very devil incarnal; and, in my conscience, my conscience is but a kind of hard conscience, to offer to counsel me to stay with the Jew. The fiend gives the more friendly counsel: I will run, fiend; my heels are at your commandment; I will run. Master young man, you; I pray you, which is the way to Master Jew's? O heavens! this is my truebegotten father, who, being more than sandblind, high-gravel blind, knows me not: I will try confusions with him. Master young gentleman, I pray you, which is the way to Master Jew's? Turn up on your right hand at the next turning, but, at the next turning of all, on your left; marry, at the very next turning, turn of no hand, but turn down indirectly to the Jew's house. By God's sonties, 'twill be a hard way to hit. Can you tell me whether one Launcelot, that dwells with him, dwell with him or no? Talk you of young Master Launcelot? Mark me now; now will I raise the waters. Talk you of young Master Launcelot? No master, sir, but a poor man's son: his father, though I say it, is an honest, exceeding poor man, and, God be thanked, well to live. Well, let his father be what a' will, we talk of young Master Launcelot. Your worship's friend, and Launcelot, sir. But I pray you, ergo, old man, ergo, I beseech you, talk you of young Master Launcelot? Of Launcelot, an't please your mastership. Ergo, Master Launcelot. Talk not of Master Launcelot, father; for the young gentleman,â€”according to Fates and Destinies and such odd sayings, the Sisters Three and such branches of learning,â€”is, indeed, deceased; or, as you would say in plain terms, gone to heaven. Marry, God forbid! the boy was the very staff of my age, my very prop. Do I look like a cudgel or a hovel-post, a staff or a prop? Do you know me, father? Alack the day! I know you not, young gentleman: but I pray you, tell me, is my boy,â€”God rest his soul!â€”alive or dead? Do you not know me, father? Alack, sir, I am sand-blind; I know you not. Nay, indeed, if you had your eyes, you might fail of the knowing me: it is a wise father that knows his own child. Well, old man, I will tell you news of your son. Give me your blessing; truth will come to light; murder cannot be hid long; a man's son may, but, in the end, truth will out. Pray you, sir, stand up. I am sure you are not Launcelot, my boy. Pray you, let's have no more fooling about it, but give me your blessing: I am Launcelot, your boy that was, your son that is, your child that shall be. I cannot think you are my son. I know not what I shall think of that; but I am Launcelot, the Jew's man, and I am sure Margery your wife is my mother. Her name is Margery, indeed: I'll be sworn, if thou be Launcelot, thou art mine own flesh and blood. Lord worshipped might he be! what a beard hast thou got! thou hast got more hair on thy chin than Dobbin my thill-horse has on his tail. It should seem then that Dobbin's tail grows backward: I am sure he had more hair on his tail than I have on my face, when I last saw him. Lord! how art thou changed. How dost thou and thy master agree? I have brought him a present. How 'gree you now? Well, well: but, for mine own part, as I have set up my rest to run away, so I will not rest till I have run some ground. My master's a very Jew: give him a present! give him a halter: I am farnished in his service; you may tell every finger I have with my ribs. Father, I am glad you are come: give me your present to one Master Bassanio, who, indeed, gives rare new liveries. If I serve not him, I will run as far as God has any ground. O rare fortune! here comes the man: to him, father; for I am a Jew, if I serve the Jew any longer. You may do so; but let it be so hasted that supper be ready at the very furthest by five of the clock. See these letters delivered; put the liveries to making; and desire Gratiano to come anon to my lodging. To him, father. God bless your worship! Gramercy! wouldst thou aught with me? Here's my son, sir, a poor boy,â€” Not a poor boy, sir, but the rich Jew's man; that would, sir,â€”as my father shall specify,â€” He hath a great infection, sir, as one would say, to serveâ€” Indeed, the short and the long is, I serve the Jew, and have a desire, as my father shall specify,â€” His master and he, saving your worship's reverence, are scarce cater-cousins,â€” To be brief, the very truth is that the Jew having done me wrong, doth cause me,â€”as my father, being, I hope, an old man, shall frutify unto you,â€” I have here a dish of doves that I would bestow upon your worship, and my suit is,â€” In very brief, the suit is impertinent to myself, as your worship shall know by this honest old man; and, though I say it, though old man, yet poor man, my father. One speak for both. What would you? Serve you, sir. That is the very defect of the matter, sir. I know thee well; thou hast obtain'd thy suit: Shylock thy master spoke with me this day, And hath preferr'd thee, if it be preferment To leave a rich Jew's service, to become The follower of so poor a gentleman. The old proverb is very well parted between my master Shylock and you, sir: you have the grace of God, sir, and he hath enough. Thou speak'st it well. Go, father, with thy son. Take leave of thy old master, and inquire My lodging out. Give him a livery More guarded than his fellows': see it done. Father, in. I cannot get a service, no; I have ne'er a tongue in my head. Well, if any man in Italy have a fairer table which doth offer to swear upon a book, I shall have good fortune. Go to; here's a simple line of life: here's a small trifle of wives: alas! fifteen wives is nothing: a 'leven widows and nine maids is a simple coming-in for one man; and then to 'scape drowning thrice, and to be in peril of my life with the edge of a feather-bed; here are simple 'scapes. Well, if Fortune be a woman, she's a good wench for this gear. Father, come; I'll take my leave of the Jew in the twinkling of an eye. I pray thee, good Leonardo, think on this: These things being bought, and orderly bestow'd, Return in haste, for I do feast to-night My best-esteem'd acquaintance: hie thee, go. My best endeavours shall be done herein. Where is your master? Yonder, sir, he walks. Signior Bassanio!â€” Gratiano! I have a suit to you. You have obtain'd it. You must not deny me: I must go with you to Belmont. Why, then you must. But hear thee, Gratiano; Thou art too wild, too rude and bold of voice; Parts that become thee happily enough, And in such eyes as ours appear not faults; But where thou art not known, why, there they show Something too liberal. Pray thee, take pain To allay with some cold drops of modesty Thy skipping spirit, lest, through thy wild behaviour, I be misconstru'd in the place I go to, And lose my hopes. Signior Bassanio, hear me: If I do not put on a sober habit, Talk with respect, and swear but now and then, Wear prayer-books in my pocket, look demurely, Nay more, while grace is saying, hood mine eyes Thus with my hat, and sigh, and say 'amen;' Use all the observance of civility, Like one well studied in a sad ostent To please his grandam, never trust me more. Well, we shall see your bearing. Nay, but I bar to-night; you shall not gauge me By what we do to-night. No, that were pity: I would entreat you rather to put on Your boldest suit of mirth, for we have friends That purpose merriment. But fare you well: I have some business. And I must to Lorenzo and the rest; But we will visit you at supper-time. I am sorry thou wilt leave my father so: Our house is hell, and thou, a merry devil, Didst rob it of some taste of tediousness. But fare thee well; there is a ducat for thee: And, Launcelot, soon at supper shalt thou see Lorenzo, who is thy new master's guest: Give him this letter; do it secretly; And so farewell: I would not have my father See me in talk with thee. Adieu! tears exhibit my tongue. Most beautiful pagan, most sweet Jew! If a Christian did not play the knave and get thee, I am much deceived. But, adieu! these foolish drops do somewhat drown my manly spirit: adieu! Farewell, good Launcelot. Alack, what heinous sin is it in me To be asham'd to be my father's child! But though I am a daughter to his blood, I am not to his manners. O Lorenzo! If thou keep promise, I shall end this strife, Become a Christian, and thy loving wife. Nay, we will slink away in supper-time, Disguise us at my lodging, and return All in an hour. We have not made good preparation. We have not spoke us yet of torch-bearers. 'Tis vile, unless it may be quaintly order'd, And better, in my mind, not undertook. 'Tis now but four o'clock: we have two hours To furnish us. Friend Launcelot, what's the news? An it shall please you to break up this, it shall seem to signify. I know the hand: in faith, 'tis a fair hand; And whiter than the paper it writ on Is the fair hand that writ. Love news, in faith. By your leave, sir. Whither goest thou? Marry, sir, to bid my old master, the Jew, to sup to-night with my new master, the Christian. Hold here, take this: tell gentle Jessica I will not fail her; speak it privately. Go, gentlemen, Will you prepare you for this masque to-night? I am provided of a torch-bearer. Ay, marry, I'll be gone about it straight. And so will I. Meet me and Gratiano At Gratiano's lodging some hour hence. 'Tis good we do so. Was not that letter from fair Jessica? I must needs tell thee all. She hath directed How I shall take her from her father's house; What gold and jewels she is furnish'd with; What page's suit she hath in readiness. If e'er the Jew her father come to heaven, It will be for his gentle daughter's sake; And never dare misfortune cross her foot, Unless she do it under this excuse, That she is issue to a faithless Jew. Come, go with me: peruse this as thou goest. Fair Jessica shall be my torch-bearer. Well, thou shalt see, thy eyes shall be thy judge, The difference of old Shylock and Bassanio:â€” What, Jessicalâ€”thou shalt not gormandize, As thou hast done with me;â€”What, Jessicalâ€” And sleep and snore, and rend apparel outâ€” Why, Jessica, I say! Why, Jessica! Who bids thee call? I do not bid thee call. Your worship was wont to tell me that I could do nothing without bidding. Call you? What is your will? I am bid forth to supper, Jessica: There are my keys. But wherefore should I go? I am not bid for love; they flatter me: But yet I'll go in hate, to feed upon The prodigal Christian. Jessica, my girl, Look to my house. I am right loath to go: There is some ill a-brewing towards my rest, For I did dream of money-bags to-night. I beseech you, sir, go: my young master doth expect your reproach. So do I his. And they have conspired together: I will not say you shall see a masque; but if you do, then it was not for nothing that my nose fell a-bleeding on Black-Monday last, at six o'clock i' the morning, falling out that year on Ash-Wednesday was four year in the afternoon. What! are there masques? Hear you me, Jessica: Lock up my doors; and when you hear the drum, And the vile squealing of the wry-neck'd fife, Clamber not you up to the casements then, Nor thrust your head into the public street To gaze on Christian fools with varnish'd faces, But stop my house's ears, I mean my casements; Let not the sound of shallow foppery enter My sober house. By Jacob's staff I swear I have no mind of feasting forth to-night; But I will go. Go you before me, sirrah; Say I will come. I will go before, air. Mistress, look out at window, for all this; There will come a Christian by, Will be worth a Jewess' eye. What says that fool of Hagar's offspring, ha? His words were, 'Farewell, mistress;' nothing else. The patch is kind enough, but a huge feeder; Snail-slow in profit, and he sleeps by day More than the wild cat: drones hive not with me; Therefore I part with him, and part with him To one that I would have him help to waste His borrow'd purse. Well, Jessica, go in: Perhaps I will return immediately: Do as I bid you; shut doors after you: 'Fast bind, fast find,' A proverb never stale in thrifty mind. Farewell; and if my fortune be not crost, I have a father, you a daughter, lost. This is the penthouse under which Lorenzo Desir'd us to make stand. His hour is almost past. And it is marvel he out-dwells his hour, For lovers ever run before the clock. O! ten times faster Venus' pigeons fly To seal love's bonds new-made, than they are wont To keep obliged faith unforfeited! That ever holds: who riseth from a feast With that keen appetite that he sits down? Where is the horse that doth untread again His tedious measures with the unbated fire That he did pace them first? All things that are, Are with more spirit chased than enjoy'd. How like a younker or a prodigal The scarfed bark puts from her native bay, Hugg'd and embraced by the strumpet wind! How like the prodigal doth she return, With over-weather'd ribs and ragged sails, Lean, rent, and beggar'd by the strumpet wind! Here comes Lorenzo: more of this hereafter. Sweet friends, your patience for my long abode; Not I, but my affairs, have made you wait: When you shall please to play the thieves for wives, I'll watch as long for you then. Approach; Here dwells my father Jew. Ho! who's within? Who are you? Tell me, for more certainty, Albeit I'll swear that I do know your tongue. Lorenzo, and thy love. Lorenzo, certain; and my love indeed, For whom love I so much? And now who knows But you, Lorenzo, whether I am yours? Heaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou art. Here, catch this casket; it is worth the pains. I am glad 'tis night, you do not look on me, For I am much asham'd of my exchange; But love is blind, and lovers cannot see The pretty follies that themselves commit; For if they could, Cupid himself would blush To see me thus transformed to a boy. Descend, for you must be my torch-bearer. What! must I hold a candle to my shames? They in themselves, good sooth, are too-too light. Why, 'tis an office of discovery, love, And I should be obscur'd. So are you, sweet, Even in the lovely garnish of a boy. But come at once; For the close night doth play the runaway, And we are stay'd for at Bassanio's feast. I will make fast the doors, and gild myself With some more ducats, and be with you straight. Now, by my hood, a Gentile, and no Jew. Beshrew me, but I love her heartily; For she is wise, if I can judge of her, And fair she is, if that mine eyes be true, And true she is, as she hath prov'd herself; And therefore, like herself, wise, fair, and true, Shall she be placed in my constant soul. What, art thou come? On, gentlemen; away! Our masquing mates by this time for us stay. Who's there? Signior Antonio! Fie, fie, Gratiano! where are all the rest? 'Tis nine o'clock; our friends all stay for you. No masque to-night: the wind is come about; Bassanio presently will go aboard: I have sent twenty out to seek for you. I am glad on't: I desire no more delight Than to be under sail and gone to-night. Go, draw aside the curtains, and discover The several caskets to this noble prince. Now make your choice. The first, of gold, which this inscription bears: Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire. The second, silver, which this promise carries: Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves. This third, dull lead, with warning all as blunt: Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath. How shall I know if I do choose the right? The one of them contains my picture, prince: If you choose that, then I am yours withal. Some god direct my judgment! Let me see: I will survey the inscriptions back again: What says this leaden casket? Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath. Must give: For what? for lead? hazard for lead? This casket threatens. Men that hazard all Do it in hope of fair advantages: A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross; I'll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead. What says the silver with her virgin hue? Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves. As much as he deserves! Pause there, Morocco, And weigh thy value with an even hand. If thou be'st rated by thy estimation, Thou dost deserve enough; and yet enough May not extend so far as to the lady: And yet to be afeard of my deserving Were but a weak disabling of myself. As much as I deserve! Why, that's the lady: I do in birth deserve her, and in fortunes, In graces, and in qualities of breeding; But more than these, in love I do deserve. What if I stray'd no further, but chose here? Let's see once more this saying grav'd in gold: Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire. Why, that's the lady: all the world desires her; From the four corners of the earth they come, To kiss this shrine, this mortal-breathing saint: The Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds Of wide Arabia are as throughfares now For princes to come view fair Portia: The watery kingdom, whose ambitious head Spits in the face of heaven, is no bar To stop the foreign spirits, but they come, As o'er a brook, to see fair Portia. One of these three contains her heavenly picture. Is't like that lead contains her? 'Twere damnation To think so base a thought: it were too gross To rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave. Or shall I think in silver she's immur'd, Being ten times undervalu'd to tried gold? O sinful thought! Never so rich a gem Was set in worse than gold. They have in England A coin that bears the figure of an angel Stamped in gold, but that's insculp'd upon; But here an angel in a golden bed Lies all within. Deliver me the key: Here do I choose, and thrive I as I may! There, take it, prince; and if my form lie there, Then I am yours. O hell! what have we here? A carrion Death, within whose empty eye There is a written scroll. I'll read the writing. All that glisters is not gold; Often have you heard that told: Many a man his life hath sold But my outside to behold: Gilded tombs do worms infold. Had you been as wise as bold, Young in limbs, in judgment old, Your answer had not been inscroll'd: Fare you well; your suit is cold. Cold, indeed; and labour lost: Then, farewell, heat, and welcome, frost! Portia, adieu. I have too griev'd a heart To take a tedious leave: thus losers part. A gentle riddance. Draw the curtains: go. Let all of his complexion choose me so. Why, man, I saw Bassanio under sail: With him is Gratiano gone along; And in their ship I'm sure Lorenzo is not. The villain Jew with outcries rais'd the duke, Who went with him to search Bassanio's ship. He came too late, the ship was under sail: But there the duke was given to understand That in a gondola were seen together Lorenzo and his amorous Jessica. Besides, Antonio certified the duke They were not with Bassanio in his ship. I never heard a passion so confus'd, So strange, outrageous, and so variable, As the dog Jew did utter in the streets: 'My daughter! O my ducats! O my daughter! Fled with a Christian! O my Christian ducats! Justice! the law! my ducats, and my daughter! A sealed bag, two sealed bags of ducats, Of double ducats, stol'n from me by my daughter! And jewels! two stones, two rich and precious stones, Stol'n by my daughter! Justice! find the girl! She hath the stones upon her, and the ducats.' Why, all the boys in Venice follow him, Crying, his stones, his daughter, and his ducats. Let good Antonio look he keep his day, Or he shall pay for this. Marry, well remember'd. I reason'd with a Frenchman yesterday, Who told me,â€”in the narrow seas that part The French and English,â€”there miscarried A vessel of our country richly fraught. I thought upon Antonio when he told me, And wish'd in silence that it were not his. You were best to tell Antonio what you hear; Yet do not suddenly, for it may grieve him. A kinder gentleman treads not the earth. I saw Bassanio and Antonio part: Bassanio told him he would make some speed Of his return: he answer'd 'Do not so; Slubber not business for my sake, Bassanio, But stay the very riping of the time; And for the Jew's bond which he hath of me, Let it not enter in your mind of love: Be merry, and employ your chiefest thoughts To courtship and such fair ostents of love As shall conveniently become you there:' And even there, his eye being big with tears, Turning his face, he put his hand behind him, And with affection wondrous sensible He wrung Bassanio's hand; and so they parted. I think he only loves the world for him. I pray thee, let us go and find him out, And quicken his embraced heaviness With some delight or other. Do we so. Quick, quick, I pray thee; draw the curtain straight: The Prince of Arragon hath ta'en his oath, And comes to his election presently. Behold, there stands the caskets, noble prince: If you choose that wherein I am contain'd, Straight shall our nuptial rites be solemniz'd; But if you fail, without more speech, my lord, You must be gone from hence immediately. I am enjoin'd by oath to observe three things: First, never to unfold to any one Which casket 'twas I chose; next, if I fail Of the right casket, never in my life To woo a maid in way of marriage; Lastly, If I do fail in fortune of my choice, Immediately to leave you and be gone. To these injunctions every one doth swear That comes to hazard for my worthless self. And so have I address'd me. Fortune now To my heart's hope! Gold, silver, and base lead. Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath: You shall look fairer, ere I give or hazard. What says the golden chest? ha! let me see: Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire. What many men desire! that 'many' may be meant By the fool multitude, that choose by show, Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach; Which pries not to the interior, but, like the martlet, Builds in the weather on the outward wall, Even in the force and road of casualty. I will not choose what many men desire, Because I will not jump with common spirits And rank me with the barbarous multitude. Why, then to thee, thou silver treasure-house; Tell me once more what title thou dost bear: Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves. And well said too; for who shall go about To cozen fortune and be honourable Without the stamp of merit? Let none presume To wear an undeserved dignity. O! that estates, degrees, and offices Were not deriv'd corruptly, and that clear honour Were purchas'd by the merit of the wearer. How many then should cover that stand bare; How many be commanded that command; How much low peasantry would then be glean'd From the true seed of honour; and how much honour Pick'd from the chaff and ruin of the times To be new varnish'd! Well, but to my choice: Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves. I will assume desert. Give me a key for this, And instantly unlock my fortunes here. Too long a pause for that which you find there. What's here? the portrait of a blinking idiot, Presenting me a schedule! I will read it. How much unlike art thou to Portia! How much unlike my hopes and my deservings! Who chooseth me shall have as much as he deserves. Did I deserve no more than a fool's head? Is that my prize? are my deserts no better? To offend, and judge, are distinct offices, And of opposed natures. What is here? The fire seven times tried this: Seven times tried that judgment is That did never choose amiss. Some there be that shadows kiss; Such have but a shadow's bliss: There be fools alive, I wis, Silver'd o'er; and so was this. Take what wife you will to bed, I will ever be your head: So be gone, sir: you are sped. Still more fool I shall appear By the time I linger here: With one fool's head I came to woo, But I go away with two. Sweet, adieu. I'll keep my oath, Patiently to bear my wroth. Thus hath the candle sing'd the moth. O, these deliberate fools! when they do choose, They have the wisdom by their wit to lose. The ancient saying is no heresy: 'Hanging and wiving goes by destiny.' Come, draw the curtain, Nerissa. Where is my lady? Here; what would my lord? Madam, there is alighted at your gate A young Venetian, one that comes before To signify the approaching of his lord; From whom he bringeth sensible regreets, To wit, â€” besides commends and courteous breath,â€” Gifts of rich value. Yet I have not seen So likely an embassador of love. A day in April never came so sweet, To show how costly summer was at hand, As this fore-spurrer comes before his lord. No more, I pray thee: I am half afeard Thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee, Thou spend'st such high-day wit in praising him. Come, come, Nerissa; for I long to see Quick Cupid's post that comes so mannerly. Bassanio, lord Love, if thy will it be! Now, what news on the Rialto? Why, yet it lives there unchecked that Antonio hath a ship of rich lading wracked on the narrow seas; the Goodwins, I think they call the place; a very dangerous flat, and fatal, where the carcasses of many a tall ship lie buried, as they say, if my gossip Report be an honest woman of her word. I would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever knapped ginger, or made her neighbours believe she wept for the death of a third husband. But it is true,â€”without any slips of prolixity or crossing the plain highway of talk,â€”that the good Antonio, the honest Antonio,â€”O, that I had a title good enough to keep his name company!â€” Come, the full stop. Ha! what sayst thou? Why, the end is, he hath lost a ship. I would it might prove the end of his losses. Let me say 'amen' betimes, lest the devil cross my prayer, for here he comes in the likeness of a Jew. How now, Shylock! what news among the merchants? You knew, none so well, none so well as you, of my daughter's flight. That's certain: I, for my part, knew the tailor that made the wings she flew withal. And Shylock, for his own part, knew the bird was fledged; and then it is the complexion of them all to leave the dam. She is damned for it. That's certain, if the devil may be her judge. My own flesh and blood to rebel! Out upon it, old carrion! rebels it at these years? I say my daughter is my flesh and blood. There is more difference between thy flesh and hers than between jet and ivory; more between your bloods than there is between red wine and Rhenish. But tell us, do you hear whether Antonio have had any loss at sea or no? There I have another bad match: a bankrupt, a prodigal, who dare scarce show his head on the Rialto; a beggar, that used to come so smug upon the mart; let him look to his bond: he was wont to call me usurer; let him look to his bond: he was wont to lend money for a Christian courtesy; let him look to his bond. Why, I am sure, if he forfeit thou wilt not take his flesh: what's that good for? To bait fish withal: if it will feed nothing else, it will feed my revenge. He hath disgraced me, and hindered me half a million, laughed at my losses, mocked at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted my bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine enemies; and what's his reason? I am a Jew. Hath not a Jew eyes? hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions? fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject to the same diseases, healed by the same means, warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer, as a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not bleed? if you tickle us, do we not laugh? if you poison us, do we not die? and if you wrong us, shall we not revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will resemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian, what is his humility? Revenge. If a Christian wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by Christian example? Why, revenge. The villany you teach me I will execute, and it shall go hard but I will better the instruction. Gentlemen, my master Antonio is at his house, and desires to speak with you both. We have been up and down to seek him. Here comes another of the tribe: a third cannot be matched, unless the devil himself turn Jew. How now, Tubal! what news from Genoa? Hast thou found my daughter? I often came where I did hear of her, but cannot find her. Why there, there, there! a diamond gone, cost me two thousand ducats in Frankfort! The curse never fell upon our nation till now; I never felt it till now: two thousand ducats in that; and other precious, precious jewels. I would my daughter were dead at my foot, and the jewels in her ear! would she were hearsed at my foot, and the ducats in her coffin! No news of them? Why, so: and I know not what's spent in the search: Why thouâ€”loss upon loss! the thief gone with so much, and so much to find the thief; and no satisfaction, no revenge: nor no ill luck stirring but what lights on my shoulders; no sighs but of my breathing; no tears but of my shedding. Yes, other men have ill luck too. Antonio, as I heard in Genoa,â€” What, what, what? ill luck, ill luck? â€”hath an argosy cast away, coming from Tripolis. I thank God! I thank God! Is it true? is it true? I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wrack. I thank thee, good Tubal. Good news, good news! ha, ha! Where? in Genoa? Your daughter spent in Genoa, as I heard, one night, fourscore ducats. Thou stick'st a dagger in me: I shall never see my gold again: fourscore ducats at a sitting! fourscore ducats! There came divers of Antonio's creditors in my company to Venice, that swear he cannot choose but break. I am very glad of it: I'll plague him; I'll torture him: I am glad of it. One of them showed me a ring that he had of your daughter for a monkey. Out upon her! Thou torturest me, Tubal: it was my turquoise; I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor: I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys. But Antonio is certainly undone. Nay, that's true, that's very true. Go, Tubal, fee me an officer; bespeak him a fortnight before. I will have the heart of him, if he forfeit; for, were he out of Venice, I can make what merchandise I will. Go, go, Tubal, and meet me at our synagogue; go, good Tubal; at our synagogue, Tubal. I pray you, tarry: pause a day or two Before you hazard; for, in choosing wrong. I lose your company: therefore, forbear awhile. There's something tells me, but it is not love, I would not lose you; and you know yourself, Hate counsels not in such a quality. But lest you should not understand me well,â€” And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought,â€” I would detain you here some month or two Before you venture for me. I could teach you How to choose right, but then I am forsworn; So will I never be: so may you miss me; But if you do, you'll make me wish a sin, That I had been forsworn. Beshrew your eyes, They have o'erlook'd me and divided me: One half of me is yours, the other half yours, Mine own, I would say; but if mine, then yours, And so all yours. O! these naughty times Put bars between the owners and their rights; And so, though yours, not yours. Prove it so, Let fortune go to hell for it, not I. I speak too long; but 'tis to peise the time, To eke it and to draw it out in length, To stay you from election. Let me choose; For as I am, I live upon the rack. Upon the rack, Bassanio! then confess What treason there is mingled with your love. None but that ugly treason of mistrust, Which makes me fear th' enjoying of my love: There may as well be amity and life 'Tween snow and fire, as treason and my love. Ay, but I fear you speak upon the rack, Where men enforced do speak anything. Promise me life, and I'll confess the truth. Well then, confess, and live. 'Confess' and 'love' Had been the very sum of my confession: O happy torment, when my torturer Doth teach me answers for deliverance! But let me to my fortune and the caskets. Away then! I am lock'd in one of them: If you do love me, you will find me out. Nerissa and the rest, stand all aloof. Let music sound while he doth make his choice; Then, if he lose, he makes a swan-like end, Fading in music: that the comparison May stand more proper, my eye shall be the stream And watery death-bed for him. He may win; And what is music then? then music is Even as the flourish when true subjects bow To a new-crowned monarch: such it is As are those dulcet sounds in break of day That creep into the dreaming bridegroom's ear, And summon him to marriage. Now he goes, With no less presence, but with much more love, Than young Alcides, when he did redeem The virgin tribute paid by howling Troy To the sea-monster: I stand for sacrifice; The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives, With bleared visages, come forth to view The issue of the exploit. Go, Hercules! Live thou, I live: with much, much more dismay I view the fight than thou that mak'st the fray. Tell me where is fancy bred, Or in the heart or in the head? How begot, how nourished? Reply, reply. It is engender'd in the eyes, With gazing fed; and fancy dies In the cradle where it lies Let us all ring fancy's knell; I'll begin it,â€”Ding, dong, bell. Ding, dong, bell. So may the outward shows be least themselves: The world is still deceiv'd with ornament. In law, what plea so tainted and corrupt But, being season'd with a gracious voice, Obscures the show of evil? In religion, What damned error, but some sober brow Will bless it and approve it with a text, Hiding the grossness with fair ornament? There is no vice so simple but assumes Some mark of virtue on his outward parts. How many cowards, whose hearts are all as false As stairs of sand, wear yet upon their chins The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars, Who, inward search'd, have livers white as milk; And these assume but valour's excrement To render them redoubted! Look on beauty, And you shall see 'tis purchas'd by the weight; Which therein works a miracle in nature, Making them lightest that wear most of it: So are those crisped snaky golden locks Which make such wanton gambols with the wind, Upon supposed fairness, often known To be the dowry of a second head, The skull that bred them, in the sepulchre. Thus ornament is but the guiled shore To a most dangerous sea; the beauteous scarf Veiling an Indian beauty; in a word, The seeming truth which cunning times put on To entrap the wisest. Therefore, thou gaudy gold, Hard food for Midas, I will none of thee; Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge 'Tween man and man: but thou, thou meagre lead, Which rather threat'nest than dost promise aught, Thy plainness moves me more than eloquence, And here choose I: joy be the consequence! How all the other passions fleet to air, As doubtful thoughts, and rash-embrac'd despair, And shuddering fear, and green-ey'd jealousy. O love! be moderate; allay thy ecstasy; In measure rain thy joy; scant this excess; I feel too much thy blessing; make it less, For fear I surfeit! What find I here? Fair Portia's counterfeit! What demi-god Hath come so near creation? Move these eyes? Or whether, riding on the balls of mine, Seem they in motion? Here are sever'd lips, Parted with sugar breath; so sweet a bar Should sunder such sweet friends. Here, in her hairs The painter plays the spider, and hath woven A golden mesh to entrap the hearts of men Faster than gnats in cobwebs: but her eyes!â€” How could he see to do them? having made one, Methinks it should have power to steal both his And leave itself unfurnish'd: yet look, how far The substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow In underprizing it, so far this shadow Doth limp behind the substance. Here's the scroll, The continent and summary of my fortune. You that choose not by the view, Chance as fair and choose as true! Since this fortune falls to you, Be content and seek no new. If you be well pleas'd with this And hold your fortune for your bliss, Turn you where your lady is And claim her with a loving kiss. A gentle scroll. Fair lady, by your leave; I come by note, to give and to receive. Like one of two contending in a prize, That thinks he hath done well in people's eyes, Hearing applause and universal shout, Giddy in spirit, still gazing in a doubt Whether those peals of praise be his or no; So, thrice-fair lady, stand I, even so, As doubtful whether what I see be true, Until confirm'd, sign'd, ratified by you. You see me, Lord Bassanio, where I stand, Such as I am: though for myself alone I would not be ambitious in my wish, To wish myself much better; yet, for you I would be trebled twenty times myself; A thousand times more fair, ten thousand times More rich; That only to stand high in your account, I might in virtues, beauties, livings, friends, Exceed account: but the full sum of me Is sum of nothing; which, to term in gross, Is an unlesson'd girl, unschool'd, unpractis'd; Happy in this, she is not yet so old But she may learn; happier than this, She is not bred so dull but she can learn; Happiest of all is that her gentle spirit Commits itself to yours to be directed, As from her lord, her governor, her king. Myself and what is mine to you and yours Is now converted: but now I was the lord Of this fair mansion, master of my servants, Queen o'er myself; and even now, but now, This house, these servants, and this same myself Are yours, my lord. I give them with this ring; Which when you part from, lose, or give away, Let it presage the ruin of your love, And be my vantage to exclaim on you. Madam, you have bereft me of all words, Only my blood speaks to you in my veins; And there is such confusion in my powers, As, after some oration fairly spoke By a beloved prince, there doth appear Among the buzzing pleased multitude; Where every something, being blent together, Turns to a wild of nothing, save of joy, Express'd and not express'd. But when this ring Parts from this finger, then parts life from hence: O! then be bold to say Bassanio's dead. My lord and lady, it is now our time, That have stood by and seen our wishes prosper, To cry, good joy. Good joy, my lord and lady! My Lord Bassanio and my gentle lady, I wish you all the joy that you can wish; For I am sure you can wish none from me: And when your honours mean to solemnize The bargain of your faith, I do beseech you, Even at that time I may be married too. With all my heart, so thou canst get a wife. I thank your lordship, you have got me one. My eyes, my lord, can look as swift as yours: You saw the mistress, I beheld the maid; You lov'd, I lov'd for intermission. No more pertains to me, my lord, than you. Your fortune stood upon the caskets there, And so did mine too, as the matter falls; For wooing here until I sweat again, And swearing till my very roof was dry With oaths of love, at last, if promise last, I got a promise of this fair one here To have her love, provided that your fortune Achiev'd her mistress. Is this true, Nerissa? Madam, it is, so you stand pleas'd withal. And do you, Gratiano, mean good faith? Yes, faith, my lord. Our feast shall be much honour'd in your marriage. We'll play with them the first boy for a thousand ducats. What! and stake down? No; we shall ne'er win at that sport, and stake down. But who comes here? Lorenzo and his infidel? What! and my old Venetian friend, Salanio? Lorenzo, and Salanio, welcome hither, If that the youth of my new interest here Have power to bid you welcome. By your leave, I bid my very friends and countrymen, Sweet Portia, welcome. So do I, my lord: They are entirely welcome. I thank your honour. For my part, my lord, My purpose was not to have seen you here; But meeting with Salanio by the way, He did entreat me, past all saying nay, To come with him along. I did, my lord, And I have reason for it. Signior Antonio Commends him to you. Ere I ope his letter, I pray you, tell me how my good friend doth. Not sick, my lord, unless it be in mind; Nor well, unless in mind: his letter there Will show you his estate. Nerissa, cheer yon stranger; bid her welcome. Your hand, Salanio. What's the news from Venice? How doth that royal merchant, good Antonio? I know he will be glad of our success; We are the Jasons, we have won the fleece. I would you had won the fleece that he hath lost. There are some shrewd contents in yon same paper, That steal the colour from Bassanio's cheek: Some dear friend dead, else nothing in the world Could turn so much the constitution Of any constant man. What, worse and worse! With leave, Bassanio; I am half yourself, And I must freely have the half of anything That this same paper brings you. O sweet Portia! Here are a few of the unpleasant'st words That ever blotted paper. Gentle lady, When I did first impart my love to you, I freely told you all the wealth I had Ran in my veins, I was a gentleman: And then I told you true; and yet, dear lady, Rating myself at nothing, you shall see How much I was a braggart. When I told you My state was nothing, I should then have told you That I was worse than nothing; for, indeed, I have engag'd myself to a dear friend, Engag'd my friend to his mere enemy, To feed my means. Here is a letter, lady; The paper as the body of my friend, And every word in it a gaping wound, Issuing life-blood. But is it true, Salanio? Hath all his ventures fail'd? What, not one hit? From Tripolis, from Mexico, and England, From Lisbon, Barbary, and India? And not one vessel 'scape the dreadful touch Of merchant-marring rocks? Not one, my lord. Besides, it should appear, that if he had The present money to discharge the Jew, He would not take it. Never did I know A creature, that did bear the shape of man, So keen and greedy to confound a man. He plies the duke at morning and at night, And doth impeach the freedom of the state, If they deny him justice: twenty merchants, The duke himself, and the magnificoes Of greatest port, have all persuaded with him; But none can drive him from the envious plea Of forfeiture, of justice, and his bond. When I was with him, I have heard him swear To Tubal and to Chus, his countrymen, That he would rather have Antonio's flesh Than twenty times the value of the sum That he did owe him; and I know, my lord, If law, authority, and power deny not, It will go hard with poor Antonio. Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble? The dearest friend to me, the kindest man, The best-condition'd and unwearied spirit In doing courtesies, and one in whom The ancient Roman honour more appears Than any that draws breath in Italy. What sum owes he the Jew? For me, three thousand ducats. What, no more? Pay him six thousand, and deface the bond; Double six thousand, and then treble that, Before a friend of this description Shall lose a hair thorough Bassanio's fault. First go with me to church and call me wife, And then away to Venice to your friend; For never shall you lie by Portia's side With an unquiet soul. You shall have gold To pay the petty debt twenty times over: When it is paid, bring your true friend along. My maid Nerissa and myself meantime, Will live as maids and widows. Come, away! For you shall hence upon your wedding-day. Bid your friends welcome, show a merry cheer; Since you are dear bought, I will love you dear. But let me hear the letter of your friend. Sweet Bassanio, my ships have all miscarried, my creditors grow cruel, my estate is very low, my bond to the Jew is forfeit; and since, in paying it, it is impossible I should live, all debts are cleared between you and I, if I might but see you at my death. Notwithstanding, use your pleasure: if your love do not persuade you to come, let not my letter. O love, dispatch all business, and be gone! Since I have your good leave to go away, I will make haste; but, till I come again, No bed shall e'er be guilty of my stay, Nor rest be interposer 'twixt us twain. Gaoler, look to him: tell not me of mercy; This is the fool that lent out money gratis: Gaoler, look to him. Hear me yet, good Shylock. I'll have my bond; speak not against my bond: I have sworn an oath that I will have my bond. Thou call'dst me dog before thou hadst a cause, But, since I am a dog, beware my fangs: The duke shall grant me justice. I do wonder, Thou naughty gaoler, that thou art so fond To come abroad with him at his request. I pray thee, hear me speak. I'll have my bond; I will not hear thee speak: I'll have my bond, and therefore speak no more. I'll not be made a soft and dull-eyed fool, To shake the head, relent, and sigh, and yield To Christian intercessors. Follow not; I'll have no speaking; I will have my bond. It is the most impenetrable cur That ever kept with men. Let him alone: I'll follow him no more with bootless prayers. He seeks my life; his reason well I know. I oft deliver'd from his forfeitures Many that have at times made moan to me; Therefore he hates me. I am sure the duke Will never grant this forfeiture to hold. The duke cannot deny the course of law: For the commodity that strangers have With us in Venice, if it be denied, 'Twill much impeach the justice of the state; Since that the trade and profit of the city Consisteth of all nations. Therefore, go: These griefs and losses have so bated me, That I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh To-morrow to my bloody creditor. Well, gaoler, on. Pray God, Bassanio come To see me pay his debt, and then I care not! Madam, although I speak it in your presence, You have a noble and a true conceit Of god-like amity; which appears most strongly In bearing thus the absence of your lord. But if you knew to whom you show this honour, How true a gentleman you send relief, How dear a lover of my lord your husband, I know you would be prouder of the work Than customary bounty can enforce you. I never did repent for doing good, Nor shall not now: for in companions That do converse and waste the time together, Whose souls do bear an equal yoke of love, There must be needs a like proportion Of lineaments, of manners, and of spirit; Which makes me think that this Antonio, Being the bosom lover of my lord, Must needs be like my lord. If it be so, How little is the cost I have bestow'd In purchasing the semblance of my soul From out the state of hellish cruelty! This comes too near the praising of myself; Therefore, no more of it: hear other things. Lorenzo, I commit into your hands The husbandry and manage of my house Until my lord's return: for mine own part, I have toward heaven breath'd a secret vow To live in prayer and contemplation, Only attended by Nerissa here, Until her husband and my lord's return. There is a monastery two miles off, And there will we abide. I do desire you Not to deny this imposition, The which my love and some necessity Now lays upon you. Madam, with all my heart: I shall obey you in all fair commands. My people do already know my mind, And will acknowledge you and Jessica In place of Lord Bassanio and myself. So fare you well till we shall meet again. Fair thoughts and happy hours attend on you! I wish your ladyship all heart's content. I thank you for your wish, and am well pleas'd To wish it back on you: fare you well, Jessica. Now, Balthazar, As I have ever found thee honest-true, So let me find thee still. Take this same letter, And use thou all the endeavour of a man In speed to Padua: see thou render this Into my cousin's hand, Doctor Bellario; And, look, what notes and garments he doth give thee, Bring them, I pray thee, with imagin'd speed Unto the traject, to the common ferry Which trades to Venice. Waste no time in words, But get thee gone: I shall be there before thee. Madam, I go with all convenient speed. Come on, Nerissa: I have work in hand That you yet know not of: we'll see our husbands Before they think of us. Shall they see us? They shall, Nerissa; but in such a habit That they shall think we are accomplished With that we lack. I'll hold thee any wager, When we are both accoutred like young men, I'll prove the prettier fellow of the two, And wear my dagger with the braver grace, And speak between the change of man and boy With a reed voice, and turn two mincing steps Into a manly stride, and speak of frays Like a fine bragging youth, and tell quaint lies, How honourable ladies sought my love, Which I denying, they fell sick and died: I could not do withal; then I'll repent, And wish, for all that, that I had not kill'd them: And twenty of these puny lies I'll tell, That men shall swear I have discontinu'd school Above a twelvemonth. I have within my mind A thousand raw tricks of these bragging Jacks, Which I will practise. Why, shall we turn to men? Fie, what a question's that, If thou wert near a lewd interpreter! But come: I'll tell thee all my whole device When I am in my coach, which stays for us At the park gate; and therefore haste away, For we must measure twenty miles to-day. Yes, truly; for, look you, the sins of the father are to be laid upon the children; therefore, I promise you, I fear you. I was always plain with you, and so now I speak my agitation of the matter: therefore be of good cheer; for, truly, I think you are damned. There is but one hope in it that can do you any good, and that is but a kind of bastard hope neither. And what hope is that, I pray thee? Marry, you may partly hope that your father got you not, that you are not the Jew's daughter. That were a kind of bastard hope, indeed: so the sins of my mother should be visited upon me. Truly then I fear you are damned both by father and mother: thus when I shun Scylla, your father, I fall into Charybdis, your mother: well, you are gone both ways. I shall be saved by my husband; he hath made me a Christian. Truly the more to blame he: we were Christians enow before; e'en as many as could well live one by another. This making of Christians will raise the price of hogs: if we grow all to be pork-eaters, we shall not shortly have a rasher on the coals for money. I'll tell my husband, Launcelot, what you say: here he comes. I shall grow jealous of you shortly, Launcelot, if you thus get my wife into corners. Nay, you need not fear us, Lorenzo: Launcelot and I are out. He tells me flatly, there is no mercy for me in heaven, because I am a Jew's daughter: and he says you are no good member of the commonwealth, for, in converting Jews to Christians, you raise the price of pork. I shall answer that better to the commonwealth than you can the getting up of the negro's belly: the Moor is with child by you, Launcelot. It is much that the Moor should be more than reason; but if she be less than an honest woman, she is indeed more than I took her for. How every fool can play upon the word! I think the best grace of wit will shortly turn into silence, and discourse grow commendable in none only but parrots. Go in, sirrah: bid them prepare for dinner. That is done, sir; they have all stomachs. Goodly Lord, what a wit-snapper are you! then bid them prepare dinner. That is done too, sir; only, 'cover' is the word. Will you cover, then, sir? Not so, sir, neither; I know my duty. Yet more quarrelling with occasion! Wilt thou show the whole wealth of thy wit in an instant? I pray thee, understand a plain man in his plain meaning: go to thy fellows; bid them cover the table, serve in the meat, and we will come in to dinner. For the table, sir, it shall be served in; for the meat, sir, it shall be covered; for your coming in to dinner, sir, why, let it be as humours and conceits shall govern. O dear discretion, how his words are suited! The fool hath planted in his memory An army of good words: and I do know A many fools, that stand in better place, Garnish'd like him, that for a tricksy word Defy the matter. How cheer'st thou, Jessica? And now, good sweet, say thy opinion; How dost thou like the Lord Bassanio's wife? Past all expressing. It is very meet, The Lord Bassanio live an upright life, For, having such a blessing in his lady, He finds the joys of heaven here on earth; And if on earth he do not mean it, then In reason he should never come to heaven. Why, if two gods should play some heavenly match, And on the wager lay two earthly women, And Portia one, there must be something else Pawn'd with the other, for the poor rude world Hath not her fellow. Even such a husband Hast thou of me as she is for a wife. Nay, but ask my opinion too of that. I will anon; first, let us go to dinner. Nay, let me praise you while I have a stomach. No, pray thee, let it serve for table-talk; Then howsoe'er thou speak'st, 'mong other things I shall digest it. Well, I'll set you forth. What, is Antonio here? Ready, so please your Grace. I am sorry for thee: thou art come to answer A stony adversary, an inhuman wretch Uncapable of pity, void and empty From any dram of mercy. I have heard Your Grace hath ta'en great pains to qualify His rigorous course; but since he stands obdurate, And that no lawful means can carry me Out of his envy's reach, I do oppose My patience to his fury, and am arm'd To suffer with a quietness of spirit The very tyranny and rage of his. Go one, and call the Jew into the court. He's ready at the door: he comes, my lord. Make room, and let him stand before our face. Shylock, the world thinks, and I think so too, That thou but lead'st this fashion of thy malice To the last hour of act; and then 'tis thought Thou'lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange Than is thy strange-apparent cruelty; And where thou now exact'st the penalty,â€” Which is a pound of this poor merchant's flesh,â€” Thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture, But, touch'd with human gentleness and love, Forgive a moiety of the principal; Glancing an eye of pity on his losses, That have of late so huddled on his back, Enow to press a royal merchant down, And pluck commiseration of his state From brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint, From stubborn Turks and Tartars, never train'd To offices of tender courtesy. We all expect a gentle answer, Jew. I have possess'd your Grace of what I purpose; And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn To have the due and forfeit of my bond: If you deny it, let the danger light Upon your charter and your city's freedom. You'll ask me, why I rather choose to have A weight of carrion flesh than to receive Three thousand ducats: I'll not answer that: But say it is my humour: is it answer'd? What if my house be troubled with a rat, And I be pleas'd to give ten thousand ducats To have it ban'd? What, are you answer'd yet? Some men there are love not a gaping pig; Some, that are mad if they behold a cat; And others, when the bagpipe sings i' the nose, Cannot contain their urine: for affection, Mistress of passion, sways it to the mood Of what it likes, or loathes. Now, for your answer: As there is no firm reason to be render'd, Why he cannot abide a gaping pig; Why he, a harmless necessary cat; Why he, a wauling bagpipe; but of force Must yield to such inevitable shame As to offend, himself being offended; So can I give no reason, nor I will not, More than a lodg'd hate and a certain loathing I bear Antonio, that I follow thus A losing suit against him. Are you answer'd? This is no answer, thou unfeeling man, To excuse the current of thy cruelty. I am not bound to please thee with my answer. Do all men kill the things they do not love? Hates any man the thing he would not kill? Every offence is not a hate at first. What! wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice? I pray you, think you question with the Jew: You may as well go stand upon the beach, And bid the main flood bate his usual height; You may as well use question with the wolf, Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb; You may as well forbid the mountain pines To wag their high tops, and to make no noise When they are fretted with the gusts of heaven; You may as well do anything most hard, As seek to soften thatâ€”than which what's harder?â€” His Jewish heart: therefore, I do beseech you, Make no more offers, use no further means; But with all brief and plain conveniency, Let me have judgment, and the Jew his will. For thy three thousand ducats here is six. If every ducat in six thousand ducats Were in six parts and every part a ducat, I would not draw them; I would have my bond. How shalt thou hope for mercy, rendering none? What judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong? You have among you many a purchas'd slave, Which, like your asses and your dogs and mules, You use in abject and in slavish parts, Because you bought them: shall I say to you, Let them be free, marry them to your heirs? Why sweat they under burdens? let their beds Be made as soft as yours, and let their palates Be season'd with such viands? You will answer: 'The slaves are ours:' so do I answer you: The pound of flesh which I demand of him, Is dearly bought; 'tis mine and I will have it. If you deny me, fie upon your law! There is no force in the decrees of Venice. I stand for judgment: answer; shall I have it? Upon my power I may dismiss this court, Unless Bellario, a learned doctor, Whom I have sent for to determine this, Come here to-day. My lord, here stays without A messenger with letters from the doctor, New come from Padua. Bring us the letters: call the messenger. Good cheer, Antonio! What, man, courage yet! The Jew shall have my flesh, blood, bones, and all, Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood. I am a tainted wether of the flock, Meetest for death: the weakest kind of fruit Drops earliest to the ground; and so let me: You cannot better be employ'd, Bassanio, Than to live still, and write mine epitaph. Came you from Padua, from Bellario? From both, my lord. Bellario greets your Grace. Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly? To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there. Not on thy sole, but on thy soul, harsh Jew, Thou mak'st thy knife keen; but no metal can, No, not the hangman's axe, bear half the keenness Of thy sharp envy. Can no prayers pierce thee? No, none that thou hast wit enough to make. O, be thou damn'd, inexecrable dog! And for thy life let justice be accus'd. Thou almost mak'st me waver in my faith To hold opinion with Pythagoras, That souls of animals infuse themselves Into the trunks of men: thy currish spirit Govern'd a wolf, who, hang'd for human slaughter, Even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet, And whilst thou lay'st in thy unhallow'd dam, Infus'd itself in thee; for thy desires Are wolfish, bloody, starv'd, and ravenous. Till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond, Thou but offend'st thy lungs to speak so loud: Repair thy wit, good youth, or it will fall To cureless ruin. I stand here for law. This letter from Bellario doth commend A young and learned doctor to our court. Where is he? He attendeth here hard by, To know your answer, whether you'll admit him. With all my heart: some three or four of you Go give him courteous conduct to this place. Meantime, the court shall hear Bellario's letter. Your Grace shall understand that at the receipt of your letter I am very sick; but in the instant that your messenger came, in loving visitation was with me a young doctor of Rome; his name is Balthazar. I acquainted him with the cause in controversy between the Jew and Antonio the merchant: we turned o'er many books together: he is furnished with my opinion; which, bettered with his own learning,â€”the greatness whereof I cannot enough commend,â€”comes with him, at my importunity, to fill up your Grace's request in my stead I beseech you, let his lack of years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend estimation, for I never knew so young a body with so old a head. I leave him to your gracious acceptance, whose trial shall better publish his commendation. You hear the learn'd Bellario, what he writes: And here, I take it, is the doctor come. Give me your hand. Came you from old Bellario? I did, my lord. You are welcome: take your place. Are you acquainted with the difference That holds this present question in the court? I am informed throughly of the cause. Which is the merchant here, and which the Jew? Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth. Is your name Shylock? Shylock is my name. Of a strange nature is the suit you follow; Yet in such rule that the Venetian law Cannot impugn you as you do proceed. You stand within his danger, do you not? Ay, so he says. Do you confess the bond? I do. Then must the Jew be merciful. On what compulsion must I? tell me that. The quality of mercy is not strain'd, It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven Upon the place beneath: it is twice bless'd; It blesseth him that gives and him that takes: 'Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes The throned monarch better than his crown; His sceptre shows the force of temporal power, The attribute to awe and majesty, Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings; But mercy is above this sceptred sway, It is enthroned in the hearts of kings, It is an attribute to God himself, And earthly power doth then show likest God's When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew, Though justice be thy plea, consider this, That in the course of justice none of us Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy, And that same prayer doth teach us all to render The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much To mitigate the justice of thy plea, Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there. My deeds upon my head! I crave the law, The penalty and forfeit of my bond. Is he not able to discharge the money? Yes, here I tender it for him in the court; Yea, twice the sum: if that will not suffice, I will be bound to pay it ten times o'er, On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart. If this will not suffice, it must appear That malice bears down truth. And, I beseech you, Wrest once the law to your authority: To do a great right, do a little wrong, And curb this cruel devil of his will. It must not be. There is no power in Venice Can alter a decree established: 'Twill be recorded for a precedent, And many an error by the same example Will rush into the state. It cannot be. A Daniel come to judgment! yea, a Daniel! O wise young judge, how I do honour thee! I pray you, let me look upon the bond. Here 'tis, most reverend doctor; here it is. Shylock, there's thrice thy money offer'd thee. An oath, an oath, I have an oath in heaven: Shall I lay perjury upon my soul? No, not for Venice. Why, this bond is forfeit; And lawfully by this the Jew may claim A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off Nearest the merchant's heart. Be merciful: Take thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond. When it is paid according to the tenour. It doth appear you are a worthy judge; You know the law, your exposition Hath been most sound: I charge you by the law, Whereof you are a well-deserving pillar, Proceed to judgment: by my soul I swear There is no power in the tongue of man To alter me. I stay here on my bond. Most heartily I do beseech the court To give the judgment. Why then, thus it is: You must prepare your bosom for his knife. O noble judge! O excellent young man! For, the intent and purpose of the law Hath full relation to the penalty, Which here appeareth due upon the bond. 'Tis very true! O wise and upright judge! How much more elder art thou than thy looks! Therefore lay bare your bosom. Ay, 'his breast:' So says the bond:â€”doth it not, noble judge?â€” 'Nearest his heart:' those are the very words. It is so. Are there balance here to weigh The flesh? I have them ready. Have by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge, To stop his wounds, lest he do bleed to death. Is it so nominated in the bond? It is not so express'd; but what of that? 'Twere good you do so much for charity. I cannot find it: 'tis not in the bond. You, merchant, have you anything to say? But little: I am arm'd and well prepar'd. Give me your hand, Bassanio: fare you well! Grieve not that I am fallen to this for you; For herein Fortune shows herself more kind Than is her custom: it is still her use To let the wretched man outlive his wealth, To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow An age of poverty; from which lingering penance Of such a misery doth she cut me off. Commend me to your honourable wife: Tell her the process of Antonio's end; Say how I lov'd you, speak me fair in death; And, when the tale is told, bid her be judge Whether Bassanio had not once a love. Repent not you that you shall lose your friend, And he repents not that he pays your debt; For if the Jew do cut but deep enough, I'll pay it instantly with all my heart. Antonio, I am married to a wife Which is as dear to me as life itself; But life itself, my wife, and all the world, Are not with me esteem'd above thy life: I would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all, Here to this devil, to deliver you. Your wife would give you little thanks for that, If she were by to hear you make the offer. I have a wife, whom, I protest, I love: I would she were in heaven, so she could Entreat some power to change this currish Jew. 'Tis well you offer it behind her back; The wish would make else an unquiet house. These be the Christian husbands! I have a daughter; Would any of the stock of Barabbas Had been her husband rather than a Christian! We trifle time; I pray thee, pursue sentence. A pound of that same merchant's flesh is thine: The court awards it, and the law doth give it. Most rightful judge! And you must cut this flesh from off his breast: The law allows it, and the court awards it. Most learned judge! A sentence! come, prepare! Tarry a little: there is something else. This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood; The words expressly are 'a pound of flesh:' Then take thy bond, take thou thy pound of flesh; But, in the cutting it, if thou dost shed One drop of Christian blood, thy lands and goods Are, by the laws of Venice, confiscate Unto the state of Venice. O upright judge! Mark, Jew: O learned judge! Is that the law? Thyself shalt see the act; For, as thou urgest justice, be assur'd Thou shalt have justice, more than thou desir'st. O learned judge! Mark, Jew: a learned judge! I take this offer then: pay the bond thrice, And let the Christian go. Here is the money. Soft! The Jew shall have all justice; soft! no haste:â€” He shall have nothing but the penalty. O Jew! an upright judge, a learned judge! Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh. Shed thou no blood; nor cut thou less, nor more, But just a pound of flesh: if thou tak'st more, Or less, than a just pound, be it but so much As makes it light or heavy in the substance, Or the division of the twentieth part Of one poor scruple, nay, if the scale do turn But in the estimation of a hair, Thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate. A second Daniel, a Daniel, Jew! Now, infidel, I have thee on the hip. Why doth the Jew pause? take thy forfeiture. Give me my principal, and let me go. I have it ready for thee; here it is. He hath refus'd it in the open court: He shall have merely justice, and his bond. A Daniel, still say I; a second Daniel! I thank thee, Jew, for teaching me that word. Shall I not have barely my principal? Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture, To be so taken at thy peril, Jew. Why, then the devil give him good of it! I'll stay no longer question. Tarry, Jew: The law hath yet another hold on you. It is enacted in the laws of Venice, If it be prov'd against an alien That by direct or indirect attempts He seek the life of any citizen, The party 'gainst the which he doth contrive Shall seize one half his goods; the other half Comes to the privy coffer of the state; And the offender's life lies in the mercy Of the duke only, 'gainst all other voice. In which predicament, I say, thou stand'st; For it appears by manifest proceeding, That indirectly and directly too Thou hast contriv'd against the very life Of the defendant; and thou hast incurr'd The danger formerly by me rehears'd. Down therefore and beg mercy of the duke. Beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself: And yet, thy wealth being forfeit to the state, Thou hast not left the value of a cord; Therefore thou must be hang'd at the state's charge. That thou shalt see the difference of our spirits, I pardon thee thy life before thou ask it. For half thy wealth, it is Antonio's; The other half comes to the general state, Which humbleness may drive into a fine. Ay, for the state; not for Antonio. Nay, take my life and all; pardon not that: You take my house when you do take the prop That doth sustain my house; you take my life When you do take the means whereby I live. What mercy can you render him, Antonio? A halter gratis; nothing else, for God's sake! So please my lord the duke, and all the court, To quit the fine for one half of his goods, I am content; so he will let me have The other half in use, to render it, Upon his death, unto the gentleman That lately stole his daughter: Two things provided more, that, for this favour, He presently become a Christian; The other, that he do record a gift, Here in the court, of all he dies possess'd, Unto his son Lorenzo, and his daughter. He shall do this, or else I do recant The pardon that I late pronounced here. Art thou contented, Jew? what dost thou say? I am content. Clerk, draw a deed of gift. I pray you give me leave to go from hence: I am not well. Send the deed after me, And I will sign it. Get thee gone, but do it. In christening thou shalt have two godfathers; Had I been judge, thou shouldst have had ten more, To bring thee to the gallows, not the font. Sir, I entreat you home with me to dinner. I humbly do desire your Grace of pardon: I must away this night toward Padua, And it is meet I presently set forth. I am sorry that your leisure serves you not. Antonio, gratify this gentleman, For, in my mind, you are much bound to him. Most worthy gentleman, I and my friend Have by your wisdom been this day acquitted Of grievous penalties; in lieu whereof, Three thousand ducats, due unto the Jew, We freely cope your courteous pains withal. And stand indebted, over and above, In love and service to you evermore. He is well paid that is well satisfied; And I, delivering you, am satisfied, And therein do account myself well paid: My mind was never yet more mercenary. I pray you, know me when we meet again: I wish you well, and so I take my leave. Dear sir, of force I must attempt you further: Take some remembrance of us, as a tribute, Not as a fee. Grant me two things, I pray you, Not to deny me, and to pardon me. You press me far, and therefore I will yield. Give me your gloves, I'll wear them for your sake; And, for your love, I'll take this ring from you. Do not draw back your hand; I'll take no more; And you in love shall not deny me this. This ring, good sir? alas! it is a trifle; I will not shame myself to give you this. I will have nothing else but only this; And now methinks I have a mind to it. There's more depends on this than on the value. The dearest ring in Venice will I give you, And find it out by proclamation: Only for this, I pray you, pardon me. I see, sir, you are liberal in offers: You taught me first to beg, and now methinks You teach me how a beggar should be answer'd. Good sir, this ring was given me by my wife; And, when she put it on, she made me vow That I should never sell nor give nor lose it. That 'scuse serves many men to save their gifts. An if your wife be not a mad-woman, And know how well I have deserv'd the ring, She would not hold out enemy for ever, For giving it to me. Well, peace be with you. My Lord Bassanio, let him have the ring: Let his deservings and my love withal Be valu'd 'gainst your wife's commandment. Go, Gratiano; run and overtake him; Give him the ring, and bring him, if thou canst, Unto Antonio's house. Away! make haste. Come, you and I will thither presently, And in the morning early will we both Fly toward Belmont. Come, Antonio. Inquire the Jew's house out, give him this deed, And let him sign it. We'll away to-night, And be a day before our husbands home: This deed will be well welcome to Lorenzo. Fair sir, you are well o'erta'en. My Lord Bassanio upon more advice Hath sent you here this ring, and doth entreat Your company at dinner. That cannot be: His ring I do accept most thankfully; And so, I pray you, tell him: furthermore, I pray you, show my youth old Shylock's house. That will I do. Sir, I would speak with you. I'll see if I can get my husband's ring, Which I did make him swear to keep for ever. Thou mayst, I warrant. We shall have old swearing That they did give the rings away to men; But we'll outface them, and outswear them too. Away! make haste: thou know'st where I will tarry. Come, good sir, will you show me to this house? The moon shines bright: in such a night as this, When the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees And they did make no noise, in such a night Troilus methinks mounted the Troyan walls, And sigh'd his soul toward the Grecian tents, Where Cressid lay that night. In such a night Did Thisbe fearfully o'ertrip the dew, And saw the lion's shadow ere himself, And ran dismay'd away. In such a night Stood Dido with a willow in her hand Upon the wild sea-banks, and waft her love To come again to Carthage. In such a night Medea gather'd the enchanted herbs That did renew old Ã†son. In such a night Did Jessica steal from the wealthy Jew, And with an unthrift love did run from Venice, As far as Belmont. In such a night Did young Lorenzo swear he lov'd her well, Stealing her soul with many vows of faith, And ne'er a true one. In such a night Did pretty Jessica, like a little shrew, Slander her love, and he forgave it her. I would out-night you, did no body come; But, hark! I hear the footing of a man. Who comes so fast in silence of the night? A friend. A friend! what friend? your name, I pray you, friend. Stephano is my name; and I bring word My mistress will before the break of day Be here at Belmont: she doth stray about By holy crosses, where she kneels and prays For happy wedlock hours. Who comes with her? None, but a holy hermit and her maid. I pray you, is my master yet return'd? He is not, nor we have not heard from him. But go we in, I pray thee, Jessica, And ceremoniously let us prepare Some welcome for the mistress of the house. Sola, sola! wo ha, ho! sola, sola! Who calls? Sola! did you see Master Lorenzo? Master Lorenzo! sola, sola! Leave hollaing, man; here. Sola! where? where? Here. Tell him there's a post come from my master, with his horn full of good news: my master will be here ere morning. Sweet soul, let's in, and there expect their coming. And yet no matter; why should we go in? My friend Stephano, signify, I pray you, Within the house, your mistress is at hand; And bring your music forth into the air. How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank! Here will we sit, and let the sounds of music Creep in our ears: soft stillness and the night Become the touches of sweet harmony. Sit, Jessica: look, how the floor of heaven Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold: There's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st But in his motion like an angel sings, Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubins; Such harmony is in immortal souls; But, whilst this muddy vesture of decay Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it. Come, ho! and wake Diana with a hymn: With sweetest touches pierce your mistress' ear, And draw her home with music. I am never merry when I hear sweet music. The reason is, your spirits are attentive: For do but note a wild and wanton herd, Or race of youthful and unhandled colts, Fetching mad bounds, bellowing and neighing loud, Which is the hot condition of their blood; If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound, Or any air of music touch their ears, You shall perceive them make a mutual stand, Their savage eyes turn'd to a modest gaze By the sweet power of music: therefore the poet Did feign that Orpheus drew trees, stones, and floods; Since nought so stockish, hard, and full of rage, But music for the time doth change his nature. The man that hath no music in himself, Nor is not mov'd with concord of sweet sounds, Is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils; The motions of his spirit are dull as night, And his affections dark as Erebus: Let no such man be trusted. Mark the music. That light we see is burning in my hall. How far that little candle throws his beams! So shines a good deed in a naughty world. When the moon shone, we did not see the candle. So doth the greater glory dim the less: A substitute shines brightly as a king Until a king be by, and then his state Empties itself, as doth an inland brook Into the main of waters. Music! hark! It is your music, madam, of the house. Nothing is good, I see, without respect: Methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day. Silence bestows that virtue on it, madam. The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark When neither is attended, and I think The nightingale, if she should sing by day, When every goose is cackling, would be thought No better a musician than the wren. How many things by season season'd are To their right praise and true perfection! Peace, ho! the moon sleeps with Endymion, And would not be awak'd! That is the voice, Or I am much deceiv'd, of Portia. He knows me, as the blind man knows the cuckoo, By the bad voice. Dear lady, welcome home. We have been praying for our husbands' welfare, Which speed, we hope, the better for our words. Are they return'd? Madam, they are not yet; But there is come a messenger before, To signify their coming. Go in, Nerissa: Give order to my servants that they take No note at all of our being absent hence; Nor you, Lorenzo; Jessica, nor you. Your husband is at hand; I hear his trumpet: We are no tell-tales, madam; fear you not. This night methinks is but the daylight sick; It looks a little paler: 'tis a day, Such as the day is when the sun is hid. We should hold day with the Antipodes, If you would walk in absence of the sun. Let me give light, but let me not be light; For a light wife doth make a heavy husband, And never be Bassanio so for me: But God sort all! You are welcome home, my lord. I thank you, madam. Give welcome to my friend: This is the man, this is Antonio, To whom I am so infinitely bound. You should in all sense be much bound to him, For, as I hear, he was much bound for you. No more than I am well acquitted of. Sir, you are very welcome to our house: It must appear in other ways than words, Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy. By yonder moon I swear you do me wrong; In faith, I gave it to the judge's clerk: Would he were gelt that had it, for my part, Since you do take it, love, so much at heart. A quarrel, ho, already! what's the matter? About a hoop of gold, a paltry ring That she did give me, whose poesy was For all the world like cutlers' poetry Upon a knife, 'Love me, and leave me not.' What talk you of the posy, or the value? You swore to me, when I did give it you, That you would wear it till your hour of death, And that it should lie with you in your grave: Though not for me, yet for your vehement oaths, You should have been respective and have kept it. Gave it a judge's clerk! no, God's my judge, The clerk will ne'er wear hair on's face that had it. He will, an if he live to be a man. Ay, if a woman live to be a man. Now, by this hand, I gave it to a youth, A kind of boy, a little scrubbed boy, No higher than thyself, the judge's clerk. A prating boy, that begg'd it as a fee: I could not for my heart deny it him. You were to blame,â€”I must be plain with you,â€” To part so slightly with your wife's first gift; A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger, And riveted so with faith unto your flesh. I gave my love a ring and made him swear Never to part with it; and here he stands, I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it Nor pluck it from his finger for the wealth That the world masters. Now, in faith, Gratiano, You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief: An 'twere to me, I should be mad at it. Why, I were best to cut my left hand off, And swear I lost the ring defending it. My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away Unto the judge that begg'd it, and indeed Deserv'd it too; and then the boy, his clerk, That took some pains in writing, he begg'd mine; And neither man nor master would take aught But the two rings. What ring gave you, my lord? Not that, I hope, that you receiv'd of me. If I could add a lie unto a fault, I would deny it; but you see my finger Hath not the ring upon it; it is gone. Even so void is your false heart of truth. By heaven, I will ne'er come in your bed Until I see the ring. Nor I in yours, Till I again see mine. Sweet Portia, If you did know to whom I gave the ring, If you did know for whom I gave the ring, And would conceive for what I gave the ring, And how unwillingly I left the ring, When naught would be accepted but the ring, You would abate the strength of your displeasure. If you had known the virtue of the ring, Or half her worthiness that gave the ring, Or your own honour to contain the ring, You would not then have parted with the ring. What man is there so much unreasonable, If you had pleas'd to have defended it With any terms of zeal, wanted the modesty To urge the thing held as a ceremony? Nerissa teaches me what to believe: I'll die for't but some woman had the ring. No, by my honour, madam, by my soul, No woman had it; but a civil doctor, Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me, And begg'd the ring, the which I did deny him, And suffer'd him to go displeas'd away; Even he that did uphold the very life Of my dear friend. What should I say, sweet lady? I was enforc'd to send it after him; I was beset with shame and courtesy; My honour would not let ingratitude So much besmear it. Pardon me, good lady, For, by these blessed candles of the night, Had you been there, I think you would have begg'd The ring of me to give the worthy doctor. Let not that doctor e'er come near my house. Since he hath got the jewel that I lov'd, And that which you did swear to keep for me, I will become as liberal as you; I'll not deny him anything I have; No, not my body, nor my husband's bed. Know him I shall, I am well sure of it: Lie not a night from home; watch me like Argus: If you do not, if I be left alone, Now by mine honour, which is yet mine own, I'll have that doctor for my bedfellow. And I his clerk; therefore be well advis'd How you do leave me to mine own protection. Well, do you so: let me not take him, then; For if I do, I'll mar the young clerk's pen. I am the unhappy subject of these quarrels. Sir, grieve not you; you are welcome notwithstanding. Portia, forgive me this enforced wrong; And in the hearing of these many friends, I swear to thee, even by thine own fair eyes, Wherein I see myself,â€” Mark you but that! In both my eyes he doubly sees himself; In each eye, one: swear by your double self, And there's an oath of credit. Nay, but hear me: Pardon this fault, and by my soul I swear I never more will break an oath with thee. I once did lend my body for his wealth, Which, but for him that had your husband's ring, Had quite miscarried: I dare be bound again, My soul upon the forfeit, that your lord Will never more break faith advisedly. Then you shall be his surety. Give him this, And bid him keep it better than the other. Here, Lord Bassanio; swear to keep this ring. By heaven! it is the same I gave the doctor! I had it of him: pardon me, Bassanio, For, by this ring, the doctor lay with me. And pardon me, my gentle Gratiano; For that same scrubbed boy, the doctor's clerk, In lieu of this last night did lie with me. Why, this is like the mending of highways In summer, where the ways are fair enough. What! are we cuckolds ere we have deserv'd it? Speak not so grossly. You are all amaz'd: Here is a letter; read it at your leisure; It comes from Padus, from Bellario: There you shall find that Portia was the doctor, Nerissa, there, her clerk: Lorenzo here Shall witness I set forth as soon as you And even but now return'd; I have not yet Enter'd my house. Antonio, you are welcome; And I have better news in store for you Than you expect: unseal this letter soon; There you shall find three of your argosies Are richly come to harbour suddenly. You shall not know by what strange accident I chanced on this letter. I am dumb. Were you the doctor and I knew you not? Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold? Ay; but the clerk that never means to do it, Unless he live until he be a man. Sweet doctor, you shall be my bedfellow: When I am absent, then, lie with my wife. Sweet lady, you have given me life and living; For here I read for certain that my ships Are safely come to road. How now, Lorenzo! My clerk hath some good comforts too for you. Ay, and I'll give them him without a fee. There do I give to you and Jessica, From the rich Jew, a special deed of gift, After his death, of all he dies possess'd of. Fair ladies, you drop manna in the way Of starved people. It is almost morning, And yet I am sure you are not satisfied Of these events at full. Let us go in; And charge us there upon inter'gatories, And we will answer all things faithfully. Let it be so: the first inter'gatory That my Nerissa shall be sworn on is, Whe'r till the next night she had rather stay, Or go to bed now, being two hours to day: But were the day come, I should wish it dark, That I were couching with the doctor's clerk. Well, while I live I'll fear no other thing So sore as keeping safe Nerissa's ring.\n"

      "Two households, both alike in dignity, In fair Verona, where we lay our scene, From ancient grudge break to new mutiny, Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean. From forth the fatal loins of these two foes A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life; Whose misadventur'd piteous overthrows Do with their death bury their parents' strife. The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love, And the continuance of their parents' rage, Which, but their children's end, nought could remove, Is now the two hours' traffick of our stage; The which if you with patient ears attend, What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend. Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals. No. for then we should be colliers. I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw. Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar. I strike quickly, being moved. But thou art not quickly moved to strike. A dog of the house of Montague moves me. To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to stand; therefore, if thou art moved, thou runnest away. A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's. That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes to the wall. 'Tis true; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels, are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids to the wall. The quarrel is between our masters and us their men. 'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the maids; I will cut off their heads. The heads of the maids? Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads; take it in what sense thou wilt. They must take it in sense that feel it. Me they shall feel while I am able to stand; and 'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh. 'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool; here comes two of the house of the Montagues. My naked weapon is out; quarrel, I will back thee. How! turn thy back and run? Fear me not. No, marry; I fear thee! Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin. I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list. Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them; which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir? I do bite my thumb, sir. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir? Is the law of our side if I say ay? No. No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite my thumb, sir. Do you quarrel, sir? Quarrel, sir! no, sir. If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you. No better. Well, sir. Say, 'better;' here comes one of my master's kinsmen. Yes, better, sir. You lie. Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow. Part, fools! Put up your swords; you know not what you do. What! art thou drawn among these heartless hinds? Turn-thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death. I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword, Or manage it to part these men with me. What! drawn, and talk of peace? I hate the word, As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee. Have at thee, coward! Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down! Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues! What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho! A crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a sword? My sword, I say! Old Montague is come, And flourishes his blade in spite of me. Thou villain Capulet! Hold me not; let me go. Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe. Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace, Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,â€” Will they not hear? What ho! you men, you beasts, That quench the fire of your pernicious rage With purple fountains issuing from your veins, On pain of torture, from those bloody hands Throw your mis-temper'd weapons to the ground, And hear the sentence of your moved prince. Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word, By thee, old Capulet, and Montague, Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets, And made Verona's ancient citizens Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments, To wield old partisans, in hands as old, Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate. If ever you disturb our streets again Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace. For this time, all the rest depart away: You, Capulet, shall go along with me; And, Montague, come you this afternoon To know our further pleasure in this case, To old Free-town, our common judgment-place. Once more, on pain of death, all men depart. Who set this ancient quarrel new a-broach? Speak, nephew, were you by when it began? Here were the servants of your adversary And yours close fighting ere I did approach: I drew to part them; in the instant came The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar'd, Which, as he breath'd defiance to my ears, He swung about his head, and cut the winds, Who, nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn. While we were interchanging thrusts and blows, Came more and more, and fought on part and part, Till the prince came, who parted either part. O! where is Romeo? saw you him to-day? Right glad I am he was not at this fray. Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun Peer'd forth the golden window of the east, A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad; Where, underneath the grove of sycamore That westward rooteth from the city's side, So early walking did I see your son: Towards him I made; but he was ware of me, And stole into the covert of the wood: I, measuring his affections by my own, That most are busied when they're most alone, Pursu'd my humour not pursuing his, And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me. Many a morning hath he there been seen, With tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew, Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs: But all so soon as the all-cheering sun Should in the furthest east begin to draw The shady curtains from Aurora's bed, Away from light steals home my heavy son, And private in his chamber pens himself, Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out, And makes himself an artificial night. Black and portentous must this humour prove Unless good-counsel may the cause remove. My noble uncle, do you know the cause? I neither know it nor can learn of him. Have you importun'd him by any means? Both by myself and many other friends: But he, his own affections' counsellor, Is to himself, I will not say how true, But to himself so secret and so close, So far from sounding and discovery, As is the bud bit with an envious worm, Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air, Or dedicate his beauty to the sun. Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow, We would as willingly give cure as know. See where he comes: so please you, step aside; I'll know his grievance, or be much denied. I would thou wert so happy by thy stay, To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away. Good morrow, cousin. Is the day so young? But new struck nine. Ay me! sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast? It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours? Not having that, which having, makes them short. In love? Outâ€” Of love? Out of her favour, where I am in love. Alas! that love, so gentle in his view, Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof. Alas! that love, whose view is muffled still, Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will. Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here? Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all. Here's much to do with hate, but more with love: Why then, O brawling love! O loving hate! O any thing! of nothing first create. O heavy lightness! serious vanity! Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms! Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health! Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is! This love feel I, that feel no love in this. Dost thou not laugh? No, coz, I rather weep. Good heart, at what? At thy good heart's oppression. Why, such is love's transgression. Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast, Which thou wilt propagate to have it press'd With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown Doth add more grief to too much of mine own. Love is a smoke rais'd with the fume of sighs; Being purg'd, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes; Being vex'd, a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears: What is it else? a madness most discreet, A choking gall, and a preserving sweet. Farewell, my coz. Soft, I will go along; An if you leave me so, you do me wrong. Tut! I have lost myself; I am not here; This is not Romeo, he's some other where. Tell me in sadness, who is that you love. What! shall I groan and tell thee? Groan! why, no; But sadly tell me who. Bid a sick man in sadness make his will; Ah! word ill urg'd to one that is so ill. In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman. I aim'd so near when I suppos'd you lov'd. A right good mark-man! And she's fair I love. A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit. Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit; And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd, From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd. She will not stay the siege of loving terms, Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes, Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold: O! she is rich in beauty; only poor That, when she dies, with beauty dies her store. Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste? She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste; For beauty, starv'd with her severity, Cuts beauty off from all posterity. She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair, To merit bliss by making me despair: She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow Do I live dead that live to tell it now. Be rul'd by me; forget to think of her. O! teach me how I should forget to think. By giving liberty unto thine eyes: Examine other beauties. 'Tis the way To call hers exquisite, in question more. These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows Being black put us in mind they hide the fair; He, that is strucken blind cannot forget The precious treasure of his eyesight lost: Show me a mistress that is passing fair, What doth her beauty serve but as a note Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair? Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget. I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt. But Montague is bound as well as I, In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think, For men so old as we to keep the peace. Of honourable reckoning are you both; And pity 'tis you liv'd at odds so long. But now, my lord, what say you to my suit? But saying o'er what I have said before: My child is yet a stranger in the world, She hath not seen the change of fourteen years; Let two more summers wither in their pride Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride. Younger than she are happy mothers made. And too soon marr'd are those so early made. Earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she, She is the hopeful lady of my earth: But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart, My will to her consent is but a part; An she agree, within her scope of choice Lies my consent and fair according voice. This night I hold an old accustom'd feast, Whereto I have invited many a guest Such as I love; and you, among the store, One more, most welcome, makes my number more. At my poor house look to behold this night Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light: Such comfort as do lusty young men feel When well-apparel'd April on the heel Of limping winter treads, even such delight Among fresh female buds shall you this night Inherit at my house; hear all, all see, And like her most whose merit most shall be: Which on more view, of many mine being one May stand in number, though in reckoning none. Come, go with me. Go, sirrah, trudge about Through fair Verona; find those persons out Whose names are written there, and to them say, My house and welcome on their pleasure stay. Find them out whose names are written here! It is written that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard, and the tailor with his last, the fisher with his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am sent to find those persons, whose names are here writ, and can never find what names the writing person hath here writ. I must to the learned. In good time. Tut! man, one fire burns out another's burning, One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish; Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning; One desperate grief cures with another's languish: Take thou some new infection to thy eye, And the rank poison of the old will die. Your plantain leaf is excellent for that. For what, I pray thee? For your broken shin. Why, Romeo, art thou mad? Not mad, but bound more than a madman is; Shut up in prison, kept without my food, Whipp'd and tormented, andâ€”Good den, good fellow. God gi' good den. I pray, sir, can you read? Ay, mine own fortune in my misery. Perhaps you have learn'd it without book: but, I pray, can you read any thing you see? Ay, if I know the letters and the language. Ye say honestly; rest you merry! Stay, fellow; I can read. Signior Martino and his wife and daughters; County Anselme and his beauteous sisters; the lady widow of Vitruvio; Signior Placentio, and his lovely nieces; Mercutio and his brother Valentine; mine uncle Capulet, his wife and daughters; my fair niece Rosaline; Livia; Signior Valentio and his cousin Tybalt; Lucio and the lively Helena. A fair assembly: whither should they come? Up. Whither? To supper; to our house. Whose house? My master's. Indeed, I should have asked you that before. Now I'll tell you without asking. My master is the great rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house of Montagues, I pray, come and crush a cup of wine. Rest you merry! At this same ancient feast of Capulet's, Sups the fair Rosaline, whom thou so lov'st, With all the admired beauties of Verona: Go thither; and, with unattainted eye Compare her face with some that I shall show, And I will make thee think thy swan a crow. When the devout religion of mine eye Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires! And these, who often drown'd could never die, Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars! One fairer than my love! the all-seeing sun Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun. Tut! you saw her fair, none else being by, Herself pois'd with herself in either eye; But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd Your lady's love against some other maid That I will show you shining at this feast, And she shall scant show well that now shows best. I'll go along, no such sight to be shown, But to rejoice in splendour of mine own. Nurse, where's my daughter? call her forth to me. Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,â€” I bade her come. What, lamb! what, ladybird! God forbid! where's this girl? what, Juliet! How now! who calls? Your mother. Madam, I am here. What is your will? This is the matter. Nurse, give leave awhile. We must talk in secret: nurse, come back again; I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel. Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age. Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour. She's not fourteen. I'll lay fourteen of my teethâ€” And yet to my teen be it spoken I have but fourâ€” She is not fourteen. How long is it now To Lammas-tide? A fortnight and odd days. Even or odd, of all days in the year, Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen. Susan and sheâ€”God rest all Christian souls!â€” Were of an age. Well, Susan is with God; She was too good for me. But, as I said, On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen; That shall she, marry; I remember it well. 'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years; And she was wean'd, I never shall forget it, Of all the days of the year, upon that day; For I had then laid wormwood to my dug, Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall; My lord and you were then at Mantua. Nay, I do bear a brain:â€”but, as I said, When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool! To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug. 'Shake,' quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow, To bid me trudge: And since that time it is eleven years; For then she could stand high lone; nay, by the rood, She could have run and waddled all about; For even the day before she broke her brow: And then my husbandâ€”God be with his soul! A' was a merry manâ€”took up the child: 'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face? Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit; Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my halidom, The pretty wretch left crying, and said 'Ay.' To see now how a jest shall come about! I warrant, an I should live a thousand years, I never should forget it: 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he; And, pretty fool, it stinted and said 'Ay.' Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace. Yes, madam. Yet I cannot choose but laugh, To think it should leave crying, and say 'Ay.' And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone; A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly: 'Yea,' quoth my husband, 'fall'st upon thy face? Thou wilt fall backward when thou com'st to age; Wilt thou not, Jule?' it stinted and said 'Ay.' And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I. Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace! Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed: An I might live to see thee married once, I have my wish. Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet, How stands your disposition to be married? It is an honour that I dream not of. An honour! were not I thine only nurse, I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat. Well, think of marriage now; younger than you, Here in Verona, ladies of esteem, Are made already mothers: by my count, I was your mother much upon these years That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief, The valiant Paris seeks you for his love. A man, young lady! lady, such a man As all the worldâ€”why, he's a man of wax. Verona's summer hath not such a flower. Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower. What say you? can you love the gentleman? This night you shall behold him at our feast; Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face And find delight writ there with beauty's pen; Examine every married lineament, And see how one another lends content; And what obscur'd in this fair volume lies Find written in the margent of his eyes. This precious book of love, this unbound lover, To beautify him, only lacks a cover: The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride For fair without the fair within to hide: That book in many eyes doth share the glory, That in gold clasps locks in the golden story: So shall you share all that he doth possess, By having him making yourself no less. No less! nay, bigger; women grow by men. Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love? I'll look to like, if looking liking move; But no more deep will I endart mine eye Than your consent gives strength to make it fly. Madam, the guests are come, supper served up, you called, my young lady asked for, the nurse cursed in the pantry, and everything in extremity. I must hence to wait; I beseech you, follow straight. We follow thee. Juliet, the county stays. Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days. What! shall this speech be spoke for our excuse, Or shall we on without apology? The date is out of such prolixity: We'll have no Cupid hood-wink'd with a scarf, Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath, Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper; Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke After the prompter, for our entrance: But, let them measure us by what they will, We'll measure them a measure, and be gone. Give me a torch: I am not for this ambling; Being but heavy, I will bear the light. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance. Not I, believe me: you have dancing shoes With nimble soles; I have a soul of lead So stakes me to the ground I cannot move. You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings, And soar with them above a common bound. I am too sore enpierced with his shaft To soar with his light feathers; and so bound I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe: Under love's heavy burden do I sink. And, to sink in it, should you burden love; Too great oppression for a tender thing. Is love a tender thing? it is too rough, Too rude, too boisterous; and it pricks like thorn. If love be rough with you, be rough with love; Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down. Give me a case to put my visage in: A visor for a visor! what care I, What curious eye doth quote deformities? Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me. Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in, But every man betake him to his legs. A torch for me; let wantons, light of heart, Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels, For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase; I'll be a candle holder, and look on. The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done. Tut! dun's the mouse, the constable's own word. If thou art Dun, we'll draw thee from the mire, Ofâ€”save your reverenceâ€”love, wherein thou stick'st Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho! Nay, that's not so. I mean, sir, in delay We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day. Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits Five times in that ere once in our five wits. And we mean well in going to this masque; But 'tis no wit to go. Why, may one ask? I dream'd a dream to-night. And so did I. Well, what was yours? That dreamers often lie. In bed asleep, while they do dream things true. O! then, I see, Queen Mab hath been with you. Queen Mab! What's she? She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes In shape no bigger than an agate-stone On the fore-finger of an alderman, Drawn with a team of little atomies Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep: Her waggon-spokes made of long spinners' legs; The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers; The traces, of the smallest spider's web; The collars, of the moonshine's watery beams; Her whip, of cricket's bone; the lash, of film; Her waggoner, a small grey-coated gnat, Not half so big as a round little worm Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid; Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut, Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub, Time out o' mind the fairies' coach-makers. And in this state she gallops night by night Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love; O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on curtsies straight; O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees; O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream; Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues, Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are. Sometimes she gallops o'er a courtier's nose, And then dreams he of smelling out a suit; And sometimes comes she with a tithe pig's tail, Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep, Then dreams he of another benefice; Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck, And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats, Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish bladed, Of healths five fathom deep; and then anon Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes; And, being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two, And sleeps again. This is that very Mab That plats the manes of horses in the night; And bakes the elf-locks in foul sluttish hairs, Which once untangled much misfortune bodes; This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, That presses them and learns them first to bear, Making them women of good carriage: This is sheâ€” Peace, peace! Mercutio, peace! Thou talk'st of nothing. True, I talk of dreams, Which are the children of an idle brain, Begot of nothing but vain fantasy; Which is as thin of substance as the air, And more inconstant than the wind, who woos Even now the frozen bosom of the north, And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence, Turning his face to the dew-dropping south. This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves; Supper is done, and we shall come too late. I fear too early; for my mind misgives Some consequence yet hanging in the stars Shall bitterly begin his fearful date With this night's revels, and expire the term Of a despised life clos'd in my breast By some vile forfeit of untimely death. But he, that hath the steerage of my course, Direct my sail!, On, lusty gentlemen. Strike, drum. Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away? he shift a trencher! he scrape a trencher! When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's hands, and they unwashed too, 'tis a foul thing. Away with the joint-stools, remove the court-cupboard, look to the plate. Good thou, save me a piece of marchpane; and, as thou lovest me, let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell. Antony! and Potpan! Ay, boy; ready. You are looked for and called for, asked for and sought for in the great chamber. We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys; be brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all. Welcome, gentlemen! ladies that have their toes Unplagu'd with corns will walk a bout with you. Ah ha! my mistresses, which of you all Will now deny to dance? she that makes dainty, she, I'll swear, hath corns; am I come near ye now? Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day That I have worn a visor, and could tell A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear Such as would please; 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone. You are welcome, gentlemen! Come, musicians, play. A hall! a hall! give room, and foot it, girls. More light, ye knaves! and turn the tables up, And quench the fire, the room has grown too hot. Ah! sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well. Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet, For you and I are past our dancing days; How long is 't now since last yourself and I Were in a mask? By'r Lady, thirty years. What, man! 'tis not so much, 'tis not so much: 'Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio, Come Pentecost as quickly as it will, Some five and twenty years; and then we mask'd. 'Tis more, 'tis more; his son is older, sir. His son is thirty. Will you tell me that? His son was but a ward two years ago. What lady is that which doth enrich the hand Of yonder knight? I know not, sir. O! she doth teach the torches to burn bright. It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night Like a rich jewel in an Ethiop's ear; Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear! So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows, As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows. The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand, And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand. Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight! For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night. This, by his voice, should be a Montague. Fetch me my rapier, boy. What! dares the slave Come hither, cover'd with an antick face, To fleer and scorn at our solemnity? Now, by the stock and honour of my kin, To strike him dead I hold it not a sin. Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so? Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe; A villain that is hither come in spite, To scorn at our solemnity this night. Young Romeo, is it? 'Tis he, that villain Romeo. Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone: He bears him like a portly gentleman; And, to say truth, Verona brags of him To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth. I would not for the wealth of all this town Here in my house do him disparagement; Therefore be patient, take no note of him: It is my will; the which if thou respect, Show a fair presence and put off these frowns, An ill-beseeming semblance for a feast. It fits, when such a villain is a guest: I'll not endure him. He shall be endur'd: What! goodman boy; I say, he shall, go to; Am I the master here, or you? go to. You'll not endure him! God shall mend my soul! You'll make a mutiny among my guests! You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man! Why, uncle, 'tis a shame. Go to, go to; You are a saucy boyâ€”is't so indeed?â€” This trick may chance to scathe you.â€”I know what: You must contrary me! marry, 'tis time. Well said, my hearts! You are a princox; go: Be quiet, orâ€”More light, more light!â€”For shame! I'll make you quiet. What! cheerly, my hearts! Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting. I will withdraw; but this intrusion shall Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall. If I profane with my unworthiest hand This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this; My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand To smooth that rough touch with a tenderkiss. Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, Which mannerly devotion shows in this; For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch, And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss. Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too? Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer. O! then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do; They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair. Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake. Then move not, while my prayers' effect I take. Thus from my lips, by thine, my sin is purg'd. Then have my lips the sin that they have took. Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urg'd! Give me my sin again. You kiss by the book. Madam, your mother craves a word with you. What is her mother? Marry, bachelor, Her mother is the lady of the house, And a good lady, and a wise, and virtuous: I nurs'd her daughter, that you talk'd withal; I tell you he that can lay hold of her Shall have the chinks. Is she a Capulet? O dear account! my life is my foe's debt. Away, be gone; the sport is at the best. Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest. Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone; We have a trifling foolish banquet towards. Is it e'en so? Why then, I thank you all; I thank you, honest gentlemen; good-night. More torches here! Come on then, let's to bed. Ah! sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late; I'll to my rest. Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman? The son and heir of old Tiberio. What's he that now is going out of door? Marry, that, I think, be young Petruchio. What's he, that follows there, that would not dance? I know not. Go, ask his name.â€”If he be married, My grave is like to be my wedding bed. His name is Romeo, and a Montague; The only son of your great enemy. My only love sprung from my only hate! Too early seen unknown, and known too late! Prodigious birth of love it is to me, That I must love a loathed enemy. What's this, what's this? A rime I learn'd even now Of one I danc'd withal. Anon, anon!â€” Come, let's away; the strangers are all gone. Now old desire doth in his death-bed lie, And young affection gapes to be his heir; That fair for which love groan'd for and would die, With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair. Now Romeo is belov'd and loves again, Alike bewitched by the charm of looks, But to his foe suppos'd he must complain, And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks: Being held a foe, he may not have access To breathe such vows as lovers us'd to swear; And she as much in love, her means much less To meet her new-beloved any where: But passion lends them power, time means, to meet, Tempering extremity with extreme sweet. Can I go forward when my heart is here? Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out. Romeo! my cousin Romeo! He is wise; And, on my life, hath stol'n him home to bed. He ran this way, and leap'd this orchard wall: Call, good Mercutio. Nay, I'll conjure too. Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover! Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh: Speak but one rime and I am satisfied; Cry but 'Ay me!' couple but 'love' and 'dove;' Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word. One nickname for her purblind son and heir, Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim When King Cophetua lov'd the beggar-maid. He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not; The ape is dead, and I must conjure him. I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes, By her high forehead, and her scarlet lip, By her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh, And the demesnes that there adjacent lie, That in thy likeness thou appear to us. An if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him. This cannot anger him: 'twould anger him To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle Of some strange nature, letting it there stand Till she had laid it, and conjur'd it down; That were some spite: my invocation Is fair and honest, and in his mistress' name I conjure only but to raise up him. Come, he hath hid himself among these trees, To be consorted with the humorous night: Blind is his love and best befits the dark. If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark. Now will he sit under a medlar tree, And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit As maids call medlars, when they laugh alone. O Romeo! that she were, O! that she were An open et cÃ¦tera, thou a poperin pear. Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed; This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep: Come, shall we go? Go, then; for 'tis in vain To seek him here that means not to be found. He jests at scars, that never felt a wound. But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun! Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon, Who is already sick and pale with grief, That thou her maid art far more fair than she: Be not her maid, since she is envious; Her vestal livery is but sick and green, And none but fools do wear it; cast it off. It is my lady; O! it is my love: O! that she knew she were. She speaks, yet she says nothing: what of that? Her eye discourses; I will answer it. I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks: Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven, Having some business, do entreat her eyes To twinkle in their spheres till they return. What if her eyes were there, they in her head? The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven Would through the airy region stream so bright That birds would sing and think it were not night. See! how she leans her cheek upon her hand: O! that I were a glove upon that hand, That I might touch that cheek. Ay me! She speaks: O! speak again, bright angel; for thou art As glorious to this night, being o'er my head, As is a winged messenger of heaven Unto the white-upturned wond'ring eyes Of mortals, that fall back to gaze on him When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds, And sails upon the bosom of the air. O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father, and refuse thy name; Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, And I'll no longer be a Capulet. Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this? 'Tis but thy name that is my enemy; Thou art thyself though, not a Montague. What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot, Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part Belonging to a man. O! be some other name: What's in a name? that which we call a rose By any other name would smell as sweet; So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd, Retain that dear perfection which he owes Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name; And for that name, which is no part of thee, Take all myself. I take thee at thy word. Call me but love, and I'll be new baptiz'd; Henceforth I never will be Romeo. What man art thou, that, thus bescreen'd in night, So stumblest on my counsel? By a name I know not how to tall thee who I am: My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself, Because it is an enemy to thee: Had I it written, I would tear the word. My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words Of that tongue's uttering, yet I know the sound: Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague? Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike. How cam'st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore? The orchard walls are high and hard to climb, And the place death, considering who thou art, If any of my kinsmen find thee here. With love's light wings did I o'erperch these walls; For stony limits cannot hold love out, And what love can do that dares love attempt; Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me. If they do see thee they will murder thee. Alack! there lies more peril in thine eye Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet, And I am proof against their enmity. I would not for the world they saw thee here. I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes; And but thou love me, let them find me here; My life were better ended by their hate, Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love. By whose direction found'st thou out this place? By Love, that first did prompt me to inquire; He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes. I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far As that vast shore wash'd with the furthest sea, I would adventure for such merchandise. Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face, Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night. Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny What I have spoke: but farewell compliment! Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay;' And I will take thy word; yet, if thou swear'st, Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries, They say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo! If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully: Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won, I'll frown and be perverse and say thee nay, So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world. In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond, And therefore thou mayst think my haviour light: But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true Than those that have more cunning to be strange. I should have been more strange, I must confess, But that thou over-heard'st, ere I was 'ware, My true love's passion: therefore pardon me, And not impute this yielding to light love, Which the dark night hath so discovered. Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops,â€” O! swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon, That monthly changes in her circled orb, Lest that thy love prove likewise variable. What shall I swear by? Do not swear at all; Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, Which is the god of my idolatry, And I'll believe thee. If my heart's dear loveâ€” Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee, I have no joy of this contract to-night: It is too rash, too unadvis'd, too sudden; Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be Ere one can say it lightens. Sweet, good-night! This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath, May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet. Good-night, good-night! as sweet repose and rest Come to thy heart as that within my breast! O! wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied? What satisfaction canst thou have to-night? The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine. I gave thee mine before thou didst request it; And yet I would it were to give again. Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love? But to be frank, and give it thee again. And yet I wish but for the thing I have: My bounty is as boundless as the sea, My love as deep; the more I give to thee, The more I have, for both are infinite. I hear some noise within; dear love, adieu! Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true. Stay but a little, I will come again. O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard, Being in night, all this is but a dream, Too flattering-sweet to be substantial. Three words, dear Romeo, and good-night indeed. If that thy bent of love be honourable, Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow, By one that I'll procure to come to thee, Where, and what time, thou wilt perform the rite; And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay, And follow thee my lord throughout the world. Madam! I come, anon.â€”But if thou mean'st not well, I do beseech thee,â€” Madam! By and by; I come:â€” To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief: To-morrow will I send. So thrive my soul,â€” A thousand times good-night! A thousand times the worse, to want thy light. Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from their books; But love from love, toward school with heavy looks. Hist! Romeo, hist! O! for a falconer's voice, To lure this tassel-gentle back again. Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud, Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies, And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine, With repetition of my Romeo's name. It is my soul that calls upon my name: How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night, Like softest music to attending ears! Romeo! My dear! At what o'clock to-morrow Shall I send to thee? At the hour of nine. I will not fail; 'tis twenty years till then. I have forgot why I did call thee back. Let me stand here till thou remember it. I shall forget, to have thee still stand there, Remembering how I love thy company. And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget, Forgetting any other home but this. 'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone; And yet no further than a wanton's bird, Who lets it hop a little from her hand, Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves, And with a silk thread plucks it back again, So loving-jealous of his liberty. I would I were thy bird. Sweet, so would I: Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing. Good-night, good-night! parting is such sweet sorrow That I shall say good-night till it be morrow. Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast! Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest! Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell, His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell. The grey-ey'd morn smiles on the frowning night, Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light, And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels: Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry, I must up-fill this osier cage of ours With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers. The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb; What is her burying grave that is her womb, And from her womb children of divers kind We sucking on her natural bosom find, Many for many virtues excellent, None but for some, and yet all different. O! mickle is the powerful grace that lies In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities: For nought so vile that on the earth doth live But to the earth some special good doth give, Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse: Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied, And vice sometime's by action dignified. Within the infant rind of this weak flower Poison hath residence and medicine power: For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part; Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart. Two such opposed foes encamp them still In man as well as herbs, grace and rude will; And where the worser is predominant, Full soon the canker death eats up that plant. Good morrow, father! Benedicite! What early tongue so sweet saluteth me? Young son, it argues a distemper'd head So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed: Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye, And where care lodges, sleep will never lie; But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign: Therefore thy earliness doth me assure Thou art up-rous'd by some distemperature; Or if not so, then here I hit it right, Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night. That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine. God pardon sin! wast thou with Rosaline? With Rosaline, my ghostly father? no; I have forgot that name, and that name's woe. That's my good son: but where hast thou been, then? I'll tell thee, ere thou ask it me again. I have been feasting with mine enemy, Where on a sudden one hath wounded me, That's by me wounded: both our remedies Within thy help and holy physic lies: I bear no hatred, blessed man; for, lo! My intercession likewise steads my foe. Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift; Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift. Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set On the fair daughter of rich Capulet: As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine; And all combin'd, save what thou must combine By holy marriage: when and where and how We met we woo'd and made exchange of vow, I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray, That thou consent to marry us to-day. Holy Saint Francis! what a change is here; Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear, So soon forsaken? young men's love then lies Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes. Jesu Maria! what a deal of brine Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline; How much salt water thrown away in waste, To season love, that of it doth not taste! The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears, Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears; Lo! here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet. If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine, Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline: And art thou chang'd? pronounce this sentence then: Women may fall, when there's no strength in men. Thou chidd'st me oft for loving Rosaline. For doting, not for loving, pupil mine. And bad'st me bury love. Not in a grave, To lay one in, another out to have. I pray thee, chide not; she, whom I love now Doth grace for grace and love for love allow; The other did not so. O! she knew well Thy love did read by rote and could not spell. But come, young waverer, come, go with me, In one respect I'll thy assistant be; For this alliance may so happy prove, To turn your households' rancour to pure love. O! let us hence; I stand on sudden haste. Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast. Where the devil should this Romeo be? Came he not home to-night? Not to his father's; I spoke with his man. Why that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline, Torments him so, that he will sure run mad. Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet, Hath sent a letter to his father's house. A challenge, on my life. Romeo will answer it. Any man that can write may answer a letter. Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares, being dared. Alas! poor Romeo, he is already dead; stabbed with a white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft; and is he a man to encounter Tybalt? Why, what is Tybalt? More than prince of cats, I can tell you. O! he is the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance, and proportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom; the very butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the very first house, of the first and second cause. Ah! the immortal passado! the punto reverso! the hay! The what? The pox of such antick, lisping, affecting fantasticoes, these new tuners of accents!â€”'By Jesu, a very good blade!â€”a very tall man! a very good whore.'â€”Why, is not this a lamentable thing, grandsire, that we should be thus afflicted with these strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these pardonnez-mois, who stand so much on the new form that they cannot sit at ease on the old bench? O, their bons, their bons! Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo. Without his roe, like a dried herring. O flesh, flesh, how art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch flowed in: Laura to his lady was but a kitchen-wench; marry, she had a better love to be-rime her; Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a gipsy; Helen and Hero hildings and harlots; Thisbe, a grey eye or so, but not to the purpose. Signior Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit fairly last night. Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you? The slip, sir, the slip; can you not conceive? Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy. That's as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams. Meaningâ€”to curtsy. Thou hast most kindly hit it. A most courteous exposition. Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy. Pink for flower. Right. Why, then, is my pump well flowered. Well said; follow me this jest now till thou hast worn out the pump, that, when the single sole of it is worn, the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular. O single-soled jest! solely singular for the singleness. Come between us, good Benvolio; my wit faints. Switch and spurs, switch and spurs; or I'll cry a match. Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I have done, for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five. Was I with you there for the goose? Thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not here for the goose. I will bite thee by the ear for that jest. Nay, good goose, bite not. Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most sharp sauce. And is it not then well served in to a sweet goose? O! here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch narrow to an ell broad. I stretch it out for that word 'broad;' which added to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose. Why, is not this better now than groaning for love? now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature: for this drivelling love is like a great natural, that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole. Stop there, stop there. Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair. Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large. O! thou art deceived; I would have made it short; for I was come to the whole depth of my tale, and meant indeed to occupy the argument no longer. Here's goodly gear! A sail, a sail! Two, two; a shirt and a smock. Peter! Anon! My fan, Peter. Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the fairer face. God ye good morrow, gentlemen. God ye good den, fair gentlewoman. Is it good den? 'Tis no less, I tell you; for the bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the prick of noon. Out upon you! what a man are you! One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to mar. By my troth, it is well said; 'for himself to mar,' quoth a'?â€”Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I may find the young Romeo? I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when you have found him than he was when you sought him: I am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse. You say well. Yea! is the worst well? very well took, i' faith; wisely, wisely. If you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with you. She will indite him to some supper. A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! So ho! What hast thou found? No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie, that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent. An old hare hoar, and an old hare hoar, Is very good meat in Lent: But a hare that is hoar, is too much for a score, When it hoars ere it be spent. Romeo, will you come to your father's? we'll to dinner thither. I will follow you. Farewell, ancient lady; farewell, Lady, lady, lady. Marry, farewell! I pray you, sir, what saucy merchant was this, that was so full of his ropery? A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk, and will speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month. An a' speak anything against me, I'll take him down, an a' were lustier than he is, and twenty such Jacks; and if I cannot, I'll find those that shall. Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am none of his skeins-mates. And thou must stand by too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure! I saw no man use you at his pleasure; if I had, my weapon should quickly have been out, I warrant you. I dare draw as soon as another man, if I see occasion in a good quarrel, and the law on my side. Now, afore God, I am so vexed, that every part about me quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word; and as I told you, my young lady bade me inquire you out; what she bid me say I will keep to myself; but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her into a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of behaviour, as they say: for the gentlewoman is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing. Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I protest unto thee,â€” Good heart! and i' faith, I will tell her as much. Lord, Lord! she will be a joyful woman. What wilt thou tell her, nurse? thou dost not mark me. I will tell her, sir, that you do protest; which, as I take it, is a gentlemanlike offer. Bid her devise Some means to come to shrift this afternoon; And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell, Be shriv'd and married. Here is for thy pains. No, truly, sir; not a penny. Go to; I say, you shall. This afternoon, sir? well, she shall be there. And stay, good nurse; behind the abbey wall: Within this hour my man shall be with thee, And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair; Which to the high top-gallant of my joy Must be my convoy in the secret night. Farewell! Be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains. Farewell! Commend me to thy mistress. Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir. What sayst thou, my dear nurse? Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say, Two may keep counsel, putting one away? I warrant thee my man's as true as steel. Well, sir; my mistress is the sweetest ladyâ€”Lord, Lord!â€”when 'twas a little prating thing,â€”O! there's a nobleman in town, one Paris, that would fain lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer man; but, I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter? Ay, nurse: what of that? both with an R. Ah! mocker; that's the dog's name. R is for theâ€”No; I know it begins with some other letter: and she had the prettiest sententious of it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you good to hear it. Commend me to thy lady. Ay, a thousand times. Peter! Anon! Before, and apace. The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse; In half an hour she promis'd to return. Perchance she cannot meet him: that's not so. O! she is lame: love's heralds should be thoughts, Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams, Driving back shadows over lowering hills: Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw Love, And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings. Now is the sun upon the highmost hill Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve Is three long hours, yet she is not come. Had she affections, and warm youthful blood, She'd be as swift in motion as a ball; My words would bandy her to my sweet love, And his to me: But old folks, many feign as they were dead; Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead. O God! she comes. O honey nurse! what news? Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away. Peter, stay at the gate. Now, good sweet nurse; O Lord! why look'st thou sad? Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily; If good, thou sham'st the music of sweet news By playing it to me with so sour a face. I am aweary, give me leave awhile: Fie, how my bones ache! What a jaunce have I had! I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news. Nay, come, I pray thee, speak; good, good nurse, speak. Jesu! what haste? can you not stay awhile? Do you not see that I am out of breath? How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath? The excuse that thou dost make in this delay Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse. Is thy news good, or bad? answer to that; Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance: Let me be satisfied, is 't good or bad? Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body, though they be not to be talked on, yet they are past compare. He is not the flower of courtesy, but, I'll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy ways, wench; serve God. What! have you dined at home? No, no: but all this did I know before. What says he of our marriage? what of that? Lord! how my head aches; what a head have I! It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces. My back o' t'other side; O! my back, my back! Beshrew your heart for sending me about, To catch my death with jauncing up and down. I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well. Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love? Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I warrant, a virtuous,â€”Where is your mother? Where is my mother! why, she is within; Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest: 'Your love says, like an honest gentleman, Where is your mother?' O! God's lady dear, Are you so hot? Marry, come up, I trow; Is this the poultice for my aching bones? Henceforward do your messages yourself. Here's such a coil! come, what says Romeo? Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day? I have. Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell, There stays a husband to make you a wife: Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks, They'll be in scarlet straight at any news. Hie you to church; I must another way, To fetch a ladder, by the which your love Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark; I am the drudge and toil in your delight, But you shall bear the burden soon at night. Go; I'll to dinner: hie you to the cell. Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell. So smile the heaven upon this holy act, That after hours with sorrow chide us not! Amen, amen! but come what sorrow can, It cannot countervail the exchange of joy That one short minute gives me in her sight: Do thou but close our hands with holy words, Then love-devouring death do what he dare; It is enough I may but call her mine. These violent delights have violent ends, And in their triumph die, like fire and powder, Which, as they kiss consume: the sweetest honey Is loathsome in his own deliciousness And in the taste confounds the appetite: Therefore love moderately; long love doth so; Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow. Here comes the lady: O! so light a foot Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint: A lover may bestride the gossamer That idles in the wanton summer air, And yet not fall; so light is vanity. Good even to my ghostly confessor. Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both. As much to him, else are his thanks too much. Ah! Juliet, if the measure of thy joy Be heap'd like mine, and that thy skill be more To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue Unfold the imagin'd happiness that both Receive in either by this dear encounter. Conceit, more rich in matter than in words, Brags of his substance, not of ornament: They are but beggars that can count their worth; But my true love is grown to such excess I cannot sum up half my sum of wealth. Come, come with me, and we will make short work; For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone Till holy church incorporate two in one. I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire: The day is hot, the Capulets abroad, And, if we meet, we shall not 'scape a brawl; For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring. Thou art like one of those fellows that when he enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword upon the table and says, 'God send me no need of thee!' and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the drawer, when, indeed, there is no need. Am I like such a fellow? Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Italy; and as soon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be moved. And what to? Nay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou! why, thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast. Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes. What eye, but such an eye, would spy out such a quarrel? Thy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarrelling. Thou hast quarrelled with a man for coughing in the street, because he hath wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun. Didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter? with another, for tying his new shoes with old riband? and yet thou wilt tutor me from quarrelling! An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter. The fee-simple! O simple! By my head, here come the Capulets. By my heel, I care not. Follow me close, for I will speak to them. Gentlemen, good den! a word with one of you. And but one word with one of us? Couple it with something; make it a word and a blow. You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you will give me occasion. Could you not take some occasion without giving? Mercutio, thou consort'st with Romeo,â€” Consort! What! dost thou make us minstrels? an thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but discords: here's my fiddlestick; here's that shall make you dance. 'Zounds! consort! We talk here in the public haunt of men: Either withdraw unto some private place, Or reason coldly of your grievances, Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us. Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze; I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I. Well, peace be with you, sir. Here comes my man. But I'll be hang'd, sir, if he wear your livery: Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower; Your worship in that sense may call him 'man.' Romeo, the hate I bear thee can afford No better term than this,â€”thou art a villain. Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee Doth much excuse the appertaining rage To such a greeting; villain am I none, Therefore farewell; I see thou know'st me not. Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw. I do protest I never injur'd thee, But love thee better than thou canst devise, Till thou shalt know the reason of my love: And so, good Capulet, which name I tender As dearly as my own, be satisfied. O calm, dishonourable, vile submission! Alla stoccata carries it away. Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk? What wouldst thou have with me? Good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine lives, that I mean to make bold withal, and, as you shall use me hereafter, dry-beat the rest of the eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pilcher by the ears? make haste, lest mine be about your ears ere it be out. I am for you. Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up. Come, sir, your passado. Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons. Gentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage! Tybalt, Mercutio, the prince expressly hath Forbidden bandying in Verona streets. Hold, Tybalt! good Mercutio! I am hurt. A plague o' both your houses! I am sped. Is he gone, and hath nothing? What! art thou hurt? Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch; marry, 'tis enough. Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon. Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much. No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church door; but 'tis enough, 'twill serve: ask for me to-morrow, and you shall find me a grave man. I am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o' both your houses! 'Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of arithmetic! Why the devil came you between us? I was hurt under your arm. I thought all for the best. Help me into some house, Benvolio, Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses! They have made worms' meat of me: I have it, And soundly too:â€”your houses! This gentleman, the prince's near ally, My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt In my behalf; my reputation stain'd With Tybalt's slander, Tybalt, that an hour Hath been my kinsman. O sweet Juliet! Thy beauty hath made me effeminate, And in my temper soften'd valour's steel! O Romeo, Romeo! brave Mercutio's dead; That gallant spirit hath aspir'd the clouds, Which too untimely here did scorn the earth. This day's black fate on more days doth depend; This but begins the woe others must end. Here comes the furious Tybalt back again. Alive! in triumph! and Mercutio slain! Away to heaven, respective lenity, And fire-ey'd fury be my conduct now! Now, Tybalt, take the villain back again That late thou gav'st me; for Mercutio's soul Is but a little way above our heads, Staying for thine to keep him company: Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him. Thou wretched boy, that didst consort him here, Shalt with him hence. This shall determine that. Romeo, away! be gone! The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain. Stand not amaz'd: the prince will doom thee death If thou art taken: hence! be gone! away! O! I am Fortune's fool. Why dost thou stay? Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio? Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he? There lies that Tybalt. Up, sir, go with me. I charge thee in the prince's name, obey. Where are the vile beginners of this fray? O noble prince! I can discover all The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl: There lies the man, slain by young Romeo, That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio. Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child! O prince! O cousin! husband! O! the blood is spill'd Of my dear kinsman. Prince, as thou art true, For blood of ours shed blood of Montague. O cousin, cousin! Benvolio, who began this bloody fray? Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay: Romeo, that spoke him fair, bade him bethink How nice the quarrel was, and urg'd withal Your high displeasure: all this, uttered With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd, Could not take truce with the unruly spleen Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast, Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point, And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats Cold death aside, and with the other sends It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud, 'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and, swifter than his tongue, His agile arm beats down their fatal points, And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled; But by and by comes back to Romeo, Who had but newly entertain'd revenge, And to 't they go like lightning, for, ere I. Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain, And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly. This is the truth, or let Benvolio die. He is a kinsman to the Montague; Affection makes him false, he speaks not true: Some twenty of them fought in this black strife And all those twenty could but kill one life. I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give; Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live. Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio; Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe? Not Romeo, prince, he was Mercutio's friend, His fault concludes but what the law should end, The life of Tybalt. And for that offence Immediately we do exile him hence: I have an interest in your hate's proceeding, My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding; But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine That you shall all repent the loss of mine. I will be deaf to pleading and excuses; Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses; Therefore use none; let Romeo hence in haste, Else, when he's found, that hour is his last. Bear hence this body and attend our will: Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill. Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds, Towards PhÅ“bus' lodging; such a waggoner As PhÃ¦thon would whip you to the west, And bring in cloudy night immediately. Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night! That runaway's eyes may wink, and Romeo Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen! Lovers can see to do their amorous rites By their own beauties; or, if love be blind, It best agrees with night. Come, civil night, Thou sober-suited matron, all in black, And learn me how to lose a winning match, Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods: Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks, With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold, Think true love acted simple modesty. Come, night! come, Romeo! come, thou day in night! For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night, Whiter than new snow on a raven's back. Come, gentle night; come, loving, black-brow'd night, Give me my Romeo: and, when he shall die, Take him and cut him out in little stars, And he will make the face of heaven so fine That all the world will be in love with night, And pay no worship to the garish sun. O! I have bought the mansion of a love, But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold, Not yet enjoy'd. So tedious is this day As is the night before some festival To an impatient child that hath new robes And may not wear them. O! here comes my nurse, And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence. Now nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords That Romeo bade thee fetch? Ay, ay, the cords. Ah me! what news? why dost thou wring thy hands? Ah well-a-day! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead! We are undone, lady, we are undone! Alack the day! he's gone, he's killed, he's dead! Can heaven be so envious? Romeo can, Though heaven cannot. O! Romeo, Romeo; Who ever would have thought it? Romeo! What devil art thou that dost torment me thus? This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell. Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but 'I,' And that bare vowel, 'I,' shall poison more Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice: I am not I, if there be such an 'I;' Or those eyes shut that make thee answer 'I.' If he be slain, say 'I;' or if not 'no:' Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe. I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes, God save the mark! here on his manly breast: A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse; Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood, All in gore blood; I swounded at the sight. O break, my heart!â€”poor bankrupt, break at once! To prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty! Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here; And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier! O Tybalt, Tybalt! the best friend I had: O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman! That ever I should live to see thee dead! What storm is this that blows so contrary? Is Romeo slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead? My dearest cousin, and my dearer lord? Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom! For who is living if those two are gone? Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished; Romeo, that kill'd him, he is banished. O God! did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood? It did, it did; alas the day! it did. O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face! Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave? Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical! Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb! Despised substance of divinest show! Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st; A damned saint, an honourable villain! O, nature! what hadst thou to do in hell When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh? Was ever book containing such vile matter So fairly bound? O! that deceit should dwell In such a gorgeous palace. There's no trust, No faith, no honesty in men; all naught, All perjur'd, all dissemblers, all forsworn. Ah! where's my man? give me some aqua vitÃ¦: These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old. Shame come to Romeo! Blister'd be thy tongue For such a wish! he was not born to shame: Upon his brow shame is asham'd to sit; For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd Sole monarch of the universal earth. O! what a beast was I to chide at him. Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin? Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband? Ah! poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name, When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it? But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin? That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband: Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring; Your tributary drops belong to woe, Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy. My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain; And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband: All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then? Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death, That murder'd me: I would forget it fain; But O! it presses to my memory, Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds. 'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo banished!' That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,' Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death Was woe enough, if it had ended there: Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship, And needly will be rank'd with other griefs, Why follow'd not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,' Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both, Which modern lamentation might have mov'd? But with a rearward following Tybalt's death, 'Romeo is banished!' to speak that word Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet, All slain, all dead: 'Romeo is banished!' There is no end, no limit, measure, bound In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.â€” Where is my father and my mother, nurse? Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse: Will you go to them? I will bring you thither. Wash they his wounds with tears: mine shall be spent, When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment. Take up those cords. Poor ropes, you are beguil'd, Both you and I, for Romeo is exil'd: He made you for a highway to my bed, But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed. Come, cords; come, nurse; I'll to my wedding bed; And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead! Hie to your chamber; I'll find Romeo To comfort you: I wot well where he is. Hark ye, your Romeo will be here to-night: I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell. O! find him; give this ring to my true knight, And bid him come to take his last farewell. Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man: Affliction is enamour'd of thy parts, And thou art wedded to calamity. Father, what news? what is the prince's doom? What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand, That I yet know not? Too familiar Is my dear son with such sour company: I bring thee tidings of the prince's doom. What less than doomsday is the prince's doom? A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips, Not body's death, but body's banishment. Ha! banishment! be merciful, say 'death;' For exile hath more terror in his look, Much more than death: do not say 'banishment.' Hence from Verona art thou banished. Be patient, for the world is broad and wide. There is no world without Verona walls, But purgatory, torture, hell itself. Hence banished is banish'd from the world, And world's exile is death; then 'banished,' Is death mis-term'd. Calling death 'banished,' Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe, And smil'st upon the stroke that murders me. O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness! Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince, Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law, And turn'd that black word death to banishment: This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not. 'Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here, Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog And little mouse, every unworthy thing, Live here in heaven and may look on her; But Romeo may not: more validity, More honourable state, more courtship lives In carrion flies than Romeo: they may seize On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand, And steal immortal blessing from her lips, Who, even in pure and vestal modesty, Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin; Flies may do this, but I from this must fly: They are free men, but I am banished. And sayst thou yet that exile is not death? Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife, No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean, But 'banished' to kill me? 'Banished!' O friar! the damned use that word in hell; Howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart, Being a divine, a ghostly confessor, A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd, To mangle me with that word 'banished?' Thou fond mad man, hear me but speak a word. O! thou wilt speak again of banishment. I'll give thee armour to keep off that word; Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy, To comfort thee, though thou art banished. Yet 'banished!' Hang up philosophy! Unless philosophy can make a Juliet, Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom, It helps not, it prevails not: talk no more. O! then I see that madmen have no ears. How should they, when that wise men have no eyes? Let me dispute with thee of thy estate. Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel: Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love, An hour but married, Tybalt murdered, Doting like me, and like me banished, Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair, And fall upon the ground, as I do now, Taking the measure of an unmade grave. Arise; one knocks: good Romeo, hide thyself. Not I; unless the breath of heart-sick groans, Mist-like, infold me from the search of eyes. Hark! how they knock. Who's there? Romeo arise; Thou wilt be taken. Stay awhile! Stand up; Run to my study. By and by! God's will! What wilfulness is this! I come, I come! Who knocks so hard? whence come you? what's your will? Let me come in, and you shall know my errand: I come from Lady Juliet. Welcome, then. O holy friar! O! tell me, holy friar, Where is my lady's lord? where's Romeo? There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk. O! he is even in my mistress' case, Just in her case! O woeful sympathy! Piteous predicament! Even so lies she, Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering. Stand up, stand up; stand, an you be a man: For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand; Why should you fall into so deep an O? Nurse! Ah, sir! ah, sir! Well, death's the end of all. Spak'st thou of Juliet? how is it with her? Doth she not think me an old murderer, Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy. With blood remov'd but little from her own? Where is she? and how doth she? and what says My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love? O! she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps; And now falls on her bed; and then starts up, And Tybalt calls, and then on Romeo cries, And then down falls again. As if that name, Shot from the deadly level of a gun, Did murder her; as that name's cursed hand Murder'd her kinsman. O! tell me, friar, tell me, In what vile part of this anatomy Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack The hateful mansion. Hold thy desperate hand: Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art: Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote The unreasonable fury of a beast: Unseemly woman in a seeming man; Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both! Thou hast amaz'd me: by my holy order, I thought thy disposition better temper'd. Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself? And slay thy lady that in thy life lives, By doing damned hate upon thyself? Why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth? Since birth, and heaven, and earth, all three do meet In thes at once, which thou at once wouldst lose. Fie, fie! thou sham'st thy shape, thy love, thy wit, Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all, And usest none in that true use indeed Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit. Thy noble shape is but a form of wax, Digressing from the valour of a man; Thy dear love, sworn, but hollow perjury, Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish; Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love, Misshapen in the conduct of them both, Like powder in a skilless soldier's flask, To set a-fire by thine own ignorance, And thou dismember'd with thine own defence. What! rouse thee, man; thy Juliet is alive, For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead; There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee, But thou slew'st Tybalt; there art thou happy too: The law that threaten'd death becomes thy friend, And turns it to exile; there art thou happy: A pack of blessings light upon thy back; Happiness courts thee in her best array; But, like a misbehav'd and sullen wench, Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love. Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable. Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed, Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her; But look thou stay not till the watch be set, For then thou canst not pass to Mantua; Where thou shalt live, till we can find a time To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends, Beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back With twenty hundred thousand times more joy Than thou went'st forth in lamentation. Go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady; And bid her hasten all the house to bed, Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto: Romeo is coming. O Lord! I could have stay'd here all the night To hear good counsel: O! what learning is. My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come. Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide. Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir. Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late. How well my comfort is reviv'd by this! Go hence; good-night; and here stands all your state: Either be gone before the watch be set, Or by the break of day disguis'd from hence: Sojourn in Mantua; I'll find out your man, And he shall signify from time to time Every good hap to you that chances here. Give me thy hand; 'tis late: farewell; goodnight. But that a joy past joy calls out on me, It were a grief so brief to part with thee: Farewell. Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily, That we have had no time to move our daughter: Look you, she lov'd her kinsman Tybalt dearly, And so did I: well, we were born to die. 'Tis very late, she'll not come down to night: I promise you, but for your company, I would have been a-bed an hour ago. These times of woe afford no time to woo. Madam, good-night: commend me to your daughter. I will, and know her mind early to-morrow; To-night she's mew'd up to her heaviness. Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender Of my child's love: I think she will be rul'd In all respects by me; nay, more, I doubt it not. Wife go you to her ere you go to bed; Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love; And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday nextâ€” But, soft! what day is this? Monday, my lord. Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon; O' Thursday let it be: o' Thursday, tell her, She shall be married to this noble earl. Will you be ready? do you like this haste? We'll keep no great ado; a friend or two; For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late, It may be thought we held him carelessly, Being our kinsman, if we revel much. Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends, And there an end. But what say you to Thursday? My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow. Well, get you gone: o' Thursday be it then. Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed, Prepare her, wife, against this wedding-day. Farewell, my lord. Light to my chamber, ho! Afore me! it is so very very late, That we may call it early by and by. Good-night. Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day: It was the nightingale, and not the lark, That pierc'd the fearful hollow of thine ear; Nightly she sings on you pomegranate tree: Believe me, love, it was the nightingale. It was the lark, the herald of the morn, No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east: Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops: I must be gone and live, or stay and die. Yon light is not daylight, I know it, I: It is some meteor that the sun exhales, To be to thee this night a torch-bearer, And light thee on thy way to Mantua: Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone. Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death; I am content, so thou wilt have it so. I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye, 'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow; Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat The vaulty heaven so high above our heads: I have more care to stay than will to go: Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so. How is't, my soul? let's talk; it is not day. It is, it is; hie hence, be gone, away! It is the lark that sings so out of tune, Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps. Some say the lark makes sweet division; This doth not so, for she divideth us: Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes; O! now I would they had chang'd voices too, Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray, Hunting thee hence with hunts-up to the day. O! now be gone; more light and light it grows. More light and light; more dark and dark our woes. Madam! Nurse! Your lady mother is coming to your chamber: The day is broke; be wary, look about. Then, window, let day in, and let life out. Farewell, farewell! one kiss, and I'll descend. Art thou gone so? my lord, my love, my friend! I must hear from thee every day in the hour, For in a minute there are many days: O! by this count I shall be much in years Ere I again behold my Romeo. Farewell! I will omit no opportunity That may convey my greetings, love, to thee. O! think'st thou we shall ever meet again? I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve For sweet discourses in our time to come. O God! I have an ill-divining soul: Methinks I see thee, now thou art so low, As one dead in the bottom of a tomb: Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale. And trust me, love, in my eye so do you: Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu! adieu! O fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle: If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, fortune; For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long, But send him back. Ho, daughter! are you up? Who is't that calls? is it my lady mother? Is she not down so late, or up so early? What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither? Why, how now, Juliet! Madam, I am not well. Evermore weeping for your cousin's death? What! wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears? And if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live; Therefore, have done: some grief shows much of love; But much of grief shows still some want of wit. Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss. So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend Which you weep for. Feeling so the loss, I cannot choose but ever weep the friend. Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death, As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him. What villain, madam? That same villain, Romeo. Villain and he be many miles asunder. God pardon him! I do, with all my heart; And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart. That is because the traitor murderer lives. Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands. Would none but I might venge my cousin's death! We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not: Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua, Where that same banish'd runsgate doth live; Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram That he shall soon keep Tybalt company: And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied. Indeed, I never shall be satisfied With Romeo, till I behold himâ€”deadâ€” Is my poor heart so for a kinsman vex'd: Madam, if you could find out but a man To bear a poison, I would temper it, That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof, Soon sleep in quiet. O! how my heart abhors To hear him nam'd, and cannot come to him, To wreak the love I bore my cousin Tybalt Upon his body that hath slaughter'd him. Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man. But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl. And joy comes well in such a needy time: What are they, I beseech your ladyship? Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child; One who, to put thee from thy heaviness, Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy That thou expect'st not, nor I look'd not for. Madam, in happy time, what day is that? Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn The gallant, young, and noble gentleman, The County Paris, at Saint Peter's church, Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride. Now, by Saint Peter's church, and Peter too, He shall not make me there a joyful bride. I wonder at this haste; that I must wed Ere he that should be husband comes to woo. I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam, I will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear, It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate, Rather than Paris. These are news indeed! Here comes your father; tell him so yourself, And see how he will take it at your hands. When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew; But for the sunset of my brother's son It rains downright. How now! a conduit, girl? what! still in tears? Evermore showering? In one little body Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind; For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea, Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is, Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs; Who, raging with thy tears, and they with them, Without a sudden calm, will overset Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife! Have you deliver'd to her our decree? Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks. I would the fool were married to her grave! Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife. How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks? Is she not proud? doth she not count her bless'd, Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom? Not proud, you have; but thankful, that you have: Proud can I never be of what I hate; But thankful even for hate, that is meant love. How now! how now, chop-logic! What is this? 'Proud,' and 'I thank you,' and 'I thank you not;' And yet 'not proud;' mistress minion, you, Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds, But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next, To go with Paris to Saint Peter's church, Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither. Out, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage! You tallow face! Fie, fie! what, are you mad? Good father, I beseech you on my knees, Hear me with patience but to speak a word. Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch! I tell thee what, get thee to church o' Thursday, Or never after look me in the face. Speak not, reply not, do not answer me; My fingers itch.â€”Wife, we scarce thought us bless'd That God had lent us but this only child; But now I see this one is one too much, And that we have a curse in having her. Out on her, hilding! God in heaven bless her! You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so. And why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue, Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go. I speak no treason. O! God ye good den. May not one speak? Peace, you mumbling fool; Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl; For here we need it not. You are too hot. God's bread! it makes me mad. Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play, Alone, in company, still my care hath been To have her match'd; and having now provided A gentleman of noble parentage, Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd, Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts, Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man; And then to have a wretched puling fool, A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender, To answer 'I'll not wed,' 'I cannot love,' 'I am too young,' 'I pray you, pardon me;' But, an you will not wed, I'll pardon you: Graze where you will, you shall not house with me: Look to't, think on't, I do not use to jest. Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise. An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend; An you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets, For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee, Nor what is mine shall never do thee good. Trust to't, bethink you; I'll not be forsworn. Is there no pity sitting in the clouds, That sees into the bottom of my grief? O! sweet my mother, cast me not away: Delay this marriage for a month, a week; Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed In that dim monument where Tybalt lies. Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word. Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee. O God! O nurse! how shall this be prevented? My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven; How shall that faith return again to earth, Unless that husband send it me from heaven By leaving earth? comfort me, counsel me. Alack, alack! that heaven should practise stratagems Upon so soft a subject as myself! What sayst thou? hast thou not a word of joy? Some comfort, nurse? Faith, here it is. Romeo Is banished; and all the world to nothing That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you; Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth. Then, since the case so stands as now it doth, I think it best you married with the county. O! he's a lovely gentleman; Romeo's a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam, Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart, I think you are happy in this second match, For it excels your first: or if it did not, Your first is dead; or 'twere as good he were, As living here and you no use of him. Speakest thou from thy heart? And from my soul too; Or else beshrew them both. Amen! What! Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much. Go in; and tell my lady I am gone, Having displeas'd my father, to Laurence' cell, To make confession and to be absolv'd. Marry, I will; and this is wisely done. Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend! Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn, Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue Which she hath prais'd him with above compare So many thousand times? Go, counsellor; Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain. I'll to the friar, to know his remedy: If all else fail, myself have power to die. On Thursday, sir? the time is very short. My father Capulet will have it so; And I am nothing slow to slack his haste. You say you do not know the lady's mind: Uneven is the course, I like it not. Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death, And therefore have I little talk'd of love; For Venus smiles not in a house of tears. Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous That she doth give her sorrow so much sway, And in his wisdom hastes our marriage To stop the inundation of her tears; Which, too much minded by herself alone, May be put from her by society. Now do you know the reason of this haste. I would I knew not why it should be slow'd. Look, sir, here comes the lady towards my cell. Happily met, my lady and my wife! That may be, sir, when I may be a wife. That may be must be, love, on Thursday next. What must be shall be. That's a certain text. Come you to make confession to this father? To answer that, I should confess to you. Do not deny to him that you love me. I will confess to you that I love him. So will ye, I am sure, that you love me. If I do so, it will be of more price, Being spoke behind your back, than to your face. Poor soul, thy face is much abus'd with tears. The tears have got small victory by that; For it was bad enough before their spite. Thou wrong'st it, more than tears, with that report. That is no slander, sir, which is a truth; And what I spake, I spake it to my face. Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander'd it. It may be so, for it is not mine own. Are you at leisure, holy father, now; Or shall I come to you at evening mass? My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now: My lord, we must entreat the time alone. God shield, I should disturb devotion! Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse you: Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss. O! shut the door! and when thou hast done so, Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help! Ah! Juliet, I already know thy grief; It strains me past the compass of my wits: I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it, On Thursday next be married to this county. Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this, Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it: If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help, Do thou but call my resolution wise, And with this knife I'll help it presently, God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands; And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd, Shall be the label to another deed, Or my true heart with treacherous revolt Turn to another, this shall slay them both. Therefore, out of thy long-experienc'd time, Give me some present counsel; or behold, 'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that Which the commission of thy years and art Could to no issue of true honour bring. Be not so long to speak; I long to die, If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy. Hold, daughter; I do spy a kind of hope, Which craves as desperate an execution As that is desperate which we would prevent. If, rather than to marry County Paris, Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself, Then is it likely thou wilt undertake A thing like death to chide away this shame, That cop'st with death himself to 'scape from it; And, if thou dar'st, I'll give thee remedy. O! bid me leap, rather than marry Paris, From off the battlements of yonder tower; Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears; Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house, O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones, With reeky shanks, and yellow chapless skulls; Or bid me go into a new-made grave And hide me with a dead man in his shroud; Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble; And I will do it without fear or doubt, To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love. Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow! To-morrow night look that thou lie alone, Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber: Take thou this vial, being then in bed, And this distilled liquor drink thou off; When presently through all thy veins shall run A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse Shall keep his native progress, but surcease; No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou liv'st; The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade To paly ashes; thy eyes' windows fall, Like death, when he shuts up the day of life; Each part, depriv'd of supple government, Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death; And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death Thou shalt continue two-and-forty hours, And then awake as from a pleasant sleep. Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead: Thenâ€”as the manner of our country isâ€” In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier, Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie. In the mean time, against thou shalt awake, Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift, And hither shall he come; and he and I Will watch thy waking, and that very night Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua. And this shall free thee from this present shame; If no unconstant toy, nor womanish fear, Abate thy valour in the acting it. Give me, give me! O! tell me not of fear! Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous In this resolve. I'll send a friar with speed To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord. Love, give me strength! and strength shall help afford. Farewell, dear father! So many guests invite as here are writ. Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks. You shall have none ill, sir; for I'll try if they can lick their fingers. How canst thou try them so? Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his own fingers: therefore he that cannot lick his fingers goes not with me. Go, be gone. We shall be much unfurnish'd for this time. What! is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence? Ay, forsooth. Well, he may chance to do some good on her: A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is. See where she comes from shrift with merry look. How now, my headstrong! where have you been gadding? Where I have learn'd me to repent the sin Of disobedient opposition To you and your behests; and am enjoin'd By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here, And beg your pardon. Pardon, I beseech you! Henceforward I am ever rul'd by you. Send for the county; go tell him of this: I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning. I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell; And gave him what becomed love I might, Not stepping o'er the bounds of modesty. Why, I'm glad on't; this is well: stand up: This is as't should be. Let me see the county; Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither. Now, afore God! this reverend holy friar, All our whole city is much bound to him. Nurse, will you go with me into my closet, To help me sort such needful ornaments As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow? No, not till Thursday; there is time enough. Go, nurse, go with her. We'll to church to-morrow. We shall be short in our provision: 'Tis now near night. Tush! I will stir about, And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife: Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her; I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone; I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho! They are all forth: well, I will walk myself To County Paris; to prepare him up Against to-morrow. My heart is wondrous light, Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd. Ay, those attires are best; but, gentle nurse, I pray thee, leave me to myself to-night; For I have need of many orisons To move the heavens to smile upon my state, Which, well thou know'st, is cross and full of sin. What! are you busy, ho? need you my help? No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries As are behoveful for our state to-morrow: So please you, let me now be left alone, And let the nurse this night sit up with you; For, I am sure, you have your hands full all In this so sudden business. Good-night: Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need. Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again. I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins, That almost freezes up the heat of life: I'll call them back again to comfort me: Nurse! What should she do here? My dismal scene I needs must act alone. Come, vial. What if this mixture do not work at all? Shall I be married then to-morrow morning? No, no; this shall forbid it: lie thou there. What if it be a poison, which the friar Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead, Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd Because he married me before to Romeo? I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not, For he hath still been tried a holy man. I will not entertain so bad a thought. How if, when I am laid into the tomb, I wake before the time that Romeo Come to redeem me? there's a fearful point! Shall I not then be stifled in the vault, To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in, And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes? Or, if I live, is it not very like, The horrible conceit of death and night, Together with the terror of the place, As in a vault, an ancient receptacle, Where, for these many hundred years, the bones Of all my buried ancestors are pack'd; Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth, Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say, At some hours in the night spirits resort: Alack, alack! is it not like that I, So early waking, what with loathsome smells, And shrieks like mandrakes' torn out of the earth, That living mortals, hearing them, run mad: O! if I wake, shall I not be distraught, Environed with all these hideous fears, And madly play with my forefathers' joints, And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud? And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone, As with a club, dash out my desperate brains? O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body Upon a rapier's point. Stay, Tybalt, stay! Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee. Hold, take these keys, and fetch more spices, nurse. They call for dates and quinces in the pastry. Come, stir, stir, stir! the second cock hath crow'd, The curfew bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock: Look to the bak'd meats, good Angelica: Spare not for cost. Go, go, you cot-quean, go; Get you to bed; faith, you'll be sick to-morrow For this night's watching. No, not a whit; what! I have watch'd ere now All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick. Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time; But I will watch you from such watching now. A jealous-hood, a jealous-hood! Now, fellow, What's there? Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what. Make haste, make haste. Sirrah, fetch drier logs: Call Peter, he will show thee where they are. I have a head, sir, that will find out logs, And never trouble Peter for the matter. Mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha! Thou shalt be logger-head. Good faith! 'tis day: The county will be here with music straight, For so he said he would. I hear him near. Nurse! Wife! what, ho! What, nurse, I say! Go waken Juliet, go and trim her up; I'll go and chat with Paris. Hie, make haste, Make haste; the bridegroom he is come already: Make haste, I say. Mistress! what, mistress! Juliet! fast, I warrant her, she: Why, lamb! why, lady! fie, you slug-a-bed! Why, love, I say! madam! sweet-heart! why, bride! What! not a word? you take your pennyworths now: Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant, The County Paris hath set up his rest, That you shall rest but little. God forgive me, Marry, and amen, how sound is she asleep! I needs must wake her. Madam, madam, madam! Ay, let the county take you in your bed; He'll fright you up, i' faith. Will it not be? What, dress'd! and in your clothes! and down again! I must needs wake you. Lady! lady! lady! Alas! alas! Help! help! my lady's dead! O! well-a-day, that ever I was born. Some aqua-vitÃ¦, ho! My lord! my lady! What noise is here? O lamentable day! What is the matter? Look, look! O heavy day! O me, O me! my child, my only life, Revive, look up, or I will die with thee! Help, help! Call help. For shame! bring Juliet forth; her lord is come. She's dead, deceas'd, she's dead; alack the day! Alack the day! she's dead, she's dead! she's dead! Ha! let me see her. Out, alas! she's cold; Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff; Life and these lips have long been separated: Death lies on her like an untimely frost Upon the sweetest flower of all the field. O lamentable day! O woeful time! Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail, Ties up my tongue, and will not let me speak. Come, is the bride ready to go to church? Ready to go, but never to return. O son! the night before thy wedding-day Hath Death lain with thy wife. There she lies, Flower as she was, deflowered by him. Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir; My daughter he hath wedded: I will die, And leave him all; life, living, all is Death's! Have I thought long to see this morning's face, And doth it give me such a sight as this? Accurs'd, unhappy, wretched, hateful-day! Most miserable hour, that e'er time saw In lasting labour of his pilgrimage! But one, poor one, one poor and loving child, But one thing to rejoice and solace in, And cruel death hath catch'd it from my sight! O woe! O woeful, woeful, woeful day! Most lamentable day, most woeful day, That ever, ever, I did yet behold! O day! O day! O day! O hateful day! Never was seen so black a day as this: O woeful day, O woeful day! Beguil'd, divorced, wronged, spited, slain! Most detestable death, by thee beguil'd, By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown! O love! O life! not life, but love in death! Despis'd, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd! Uncomfortable time, why cam'st thou now To murder, murder our solemnity? O child! O child! my soul, and not my child! Dead art thou! dead! alack, my child is dead; And with my child my joys are buried! Peace, ho! for shame! confusion's cure lives not In these confusions. Heaven and yourself Had part in this fair maid; now heaven hath all, And all the better is it for the maid: Your part in her you could not keep from death, But heaven keeps his part in eternal life. The most you sought was her promotion, For 'twas your heaven she should be advanc'd; And weep ye now, seeing she is advanc'd Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself? O! in this love, you love your child so ill, That you run mad, seeing that she is well: She's not well married that lives married long; But she's best married that dies married young. Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary On this fair corse; and, as the custom is, In all her best array bear her to church; For though fond nature bids us all lament, Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment. All things that we ordained festival, Turn from their office to black funeral; Our instruments to melancholy bells, Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast, Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change, Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse, And all things change them to the contrary. Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him; And go, Sir Paris; every one prepare To follow this fair corse unto her grave. The heavens do lower upon you for some ill; Move them no more by crossing their high will. Faith, we may put up our pipes, and be gone. Honest good fellows, ah! put up, put up, for, well you know, this is a pitiful case. Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended. Musicians! O! musicians, 'Heart's ease, Heart's ease:' O! an ye will have me live, play 'Heart's ease.' Why 'Heart's ease?' O! musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My heart is full of woe;' O! play me some merry dump, to comfort me. Not a dump we; 'tis no time to play now. You will not then? No. I will then give it you soundly. What will you give us? No money, on my faith! but the gleek; I will give you the minstrel. Then will I give you the serving-creature. Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on your pate, I will carry no crotchets: I'll re you, I'll fa you. Do you note me? An you re us, and fa us, you note us. Pray you, put up your dagger, and put out your wit. Then have at you with my wit! I will dry-beat you with an iron wit, and put up my iron dagger. Answer me like men: When griping grief the heart doth wound, And doleful dumps the mind oppress, Then music with her silver soundâ€” Why 'silver sound?' why 'music with her silver sound?' What say you, Simon Catling? Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound. Pretty! What say you, Hugh Rebeck? I say 'silver sound,' because musicians sound for silver. Pretty too! What say you, James Soundpost? Faith, I know not what to say. O! I cry you mercy; you are the singer; I will say for you. It is, 'music with her silver sound,' because musicians have no gold for sounding: Then music with her silver sound With speedy help doth lend redress. What a pestilent knave is this same! Hang him, Jack! Come, we'll in here; tarry for the mourners, and stay dinner. If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep, My dreams presage some joyful news at hand: My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne; And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts. I dreamt my lady came and found me dead;â€” Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave to think,â€” And breath'd such life with kisses in my lips, That I reviv'd, and was an emperor. Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd, When but love's shadows are so rich in joy! News from Verona! How now, Balthasar? Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar? How doth my lady? Is my father well? How fares my Juliet? That I ask again; For nothing can be ill if she be well. Then she is well, and nothing can be ill; Her body sleeps in Capel's monument, And her immortal part with angels lives. I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault, And presently took post to tell it you. O! pardon me for bringing these ill news, Since you did leave it for my office, sir. Is it even so? then I defy you, stars! Thou know'st my lodging: get me ink and paper, And hire post-horses; I will hence to-night. I do beseech you, sir, have patience: Your looks are pale and wild, and do import Some misadventure. Tush, thou art deceiv'd; Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do. Hast thou no letters to me from the friar? No, my good lord. No matter; get thee gone, And hire those horses: I'll be with thee straight. Well, Juliet, I will he with thee to-night. Let's see for means: O mischief! thou art swift To enter in the thoughts of desperate men. I do remember an apothecary, And hereabouts he dwells, which late I noted In tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows, Culling of simples; meagre were his looks, Sharp misery had worn him to the bones: And in his needy shop a tortoise hung, An alligator stuff'd, and other skins Of ill-shap'd fishes; and about his shelves A beggarly account of empty boxes, Green earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds, Remnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses, Were thinly scatter'd, to make up a show. Noting this penury, to myself I said An if a man did need a poison now, Whose sale is present death in Mantua, Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him. O! this same thought did but fore-run my need, And this same needy man must sell it me. As I remember, this should be the house: Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut. What, ho! apothecary! Who calls so loud? Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor; Hold, there is forty ducats; let me have A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear As will disperse itself through all the veins That the life-weary taker may fall dead, And that the trunk may be discharg'd of breath As violently as hasty powder fir'd Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb. Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law Is death to any he that utters them. Art thou so bare, and full of wretchedness, And fear'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks, Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes, Contempt and beggary hang upon thy back; The world is not thy friend nor the world's law: The world affords no law to make thee rich; Then be not poor, but break it, and take this. My poverty, but not my will, consents. I pay thy poverty, and not thy will. Put this in any liquid thing you will, And drink it off; and, if you had the strength Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight. There is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls, Doing more murders in this loathsome world Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell: I sell thee poison, thou hast sold me none. Farewell; buy food, and get thyself in flesh. Come, cordial and not poison, go with me To Juliet's grave, for there must I use thee. Holy Franciscan friar! brother, ho! This same should be the voice of Friar John. Welcome from Mantua: what says Romeo? Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter. Going to find a bare-foot brother out, One of our order, to associate me, Here in this city visiting the sick, And finding him, the searchers of the town, Suspecting that we both were in a house Where the infectious pestilence did reign, Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth; So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd. Who bare my letter then to Romeo? I could not send it, here it is again, Nor get a messenger to bring it thee, So fearful were they of infection. Unhappy fortune! by my brotherhood, The letter was not nice, but full of charge Of dear import; and the neglecting it May do much danger. Friar John, go hence; Get me an iron crow, and bring it straight Unto my cell. Brother, I'll go and bring it thee. Now must I to the monument alone; Within these three hours will fair Juliet wake: She will beshrew me much that Romeo Hath had no notice of these accidents; But I will write again to Mantus, And keep her at my cell till Romeo come: Poor living corse, clos'd in a dead man's tomb! Give me thy torch, boy: hence, and stand aloof; Yet put it out, for I would not be seen. Under yond yew-trees lay thee all along, Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground: So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread, Being loose, unfirm with digging up of graves, But thou shalt hear it: whistle then to me, As signal that thou hear'st something approach. Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee; go. I am almost afraid to stand alone Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure. Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew, O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones; Which with sweet water nightly I will dew, Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans: The obsequies that I for thee will keep Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep. The boy gives warning something doth approach. What cursed foot wanders this way to-night, To cross my obsequies and true love's rite? What! with a torch?â€”muffle me, night, awhile. Give me that mattock, and the wrenching iron. Hold, take this letter; early in the morning See thou deliver it to my lord and father. Give me the light: upon thy life I charge thee, Whate'er thou hear'st or seest, stand all aloof, And do not interrupt me in my course. Why I descend into this bed of death, Is partly, to behold my lady's face; But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger A precious ring, a ring that I must use In dear employment: therefore hence, be gone: But, if thou, jealous, dost return to pry In what I further shall intend to do, By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint, And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs. The time and my intents are savage-wild, More fierce and more inexorable far Than empty tigers or the roaring sea. I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you. So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that: Live, and be prosperous; and farewell, good fellow. For all this same, I'll hide me here about: His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt. Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death, Gorg'd with the dearest morsel of the earth, Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open, And, in despite, I'll cram thee with more food! This is that banish'd haughty Montague, That murder'd my love's cousin, with which grief It is supposed the fair creature died; And here is come to do some villanous shame To the dead bodies: I will apprehend him.â€” Stop thy unhallow'd toil, vile Montague, Can vengeance be pursu'd further than death? Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee: Obey, and go with me; for thou must die. I must, indeed; and therefore came I hither. Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man; Fly hence and leave me: think upon these gone; Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth, Put not another sin upon my head By urging me to fury: O! be gone: By heaven, I love thee better than myself. For I come hither arm'd against myself: Stay not, be gone; live, and hereafter say A madman's mercy bade thee run away. I do defy thy conjurations, And apprehend thee for a felon here. Wilt thou provoke me? then have at thee, boy! O Lord! they fight: I will go call the watch. O, I am slain!â€”If thou be merciful, Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet. In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face: Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris! What said my man when my betossed soul Did not attend him as we rode? I think He told me Paris should have married Juliet: Said he not so? or did I dream it so? Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet, To think it was so? O! give me thy hand, One writ with me in sour misfortune's book: I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave; A grave? O, no! a lanthorn, slaughter'd youth, For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes This vault a feasting presence full of light. Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd, How oft when men are at the point of death Have they been merry! which their keepers call A lightning before death: O! how may I Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife! Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath, Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty: Thou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yet Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks, And death's pale flag is not advanced there. Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet? O! what more favour can I do to thee, Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain To sunder his that was thine enemy? Forgive me, cousin! Ah! dear Juliet, Why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe That unsubstantial Death is amorous, And that the lean abhorred monster keeps Thee here in dark to be his paramour? For fear of that I still will stay with thee, And never from this palace of dim night Depart again: here, here will I remain With worms that are thy chambermaids; O! here Will I set up my everlasting rest, And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last! Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss A dateless bargain to engrossing death! Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide! Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark! Here's to my love! O true apothecary! Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die. Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there? Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well. Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend, What torch is yond, that vainly lends his light To grubs and eyeless skulls? as I discern, It burneth in the Capel's monument. It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master, One that you love. Who is it? Romeo. How long hath he been there? Full half an hour. Go with me to the vault. I dare not, sir. My master knows not but I am gone hence; And fearfully did menace me with death If I did stay to look on his intents. Stay then, I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me; O! much I fear some ill unlucky thing. As I did sleep under this yew-tree here, I dreamt my master and another fought, And that my master slew him. Romeo! Alack, alack! what blood is this which stains The stony entrance of this sepulchre? What mean these masterless and gory swords To lie discolour'd by this place of peace? Romeo! O, pale! Who else? what! Paris too? And steep'd in blood? Ah! what an unkind hour Is guilty of this lamentable chance. The lady stirs. O, comfortable friar! where is my lord? I do remember well where I should be, And there I am. Where is my Romeo? I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep: A greater power than we can contradict Hath thwarted our intents: come, come away. Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead; And Paris too: come, I'll dispose of thee Among a sisterhood of holy nuns. Stay not to question, for the watch is coming; Come, go, good Juliet.â€” I dare no longer stay. Go, get thee hence, for I will not away. What's here? a cup, clos'd in my true love's hand? Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end. O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop To help me after! I will kiss thy lips; Haply, some poison yet doth hang on them, To make me die with a restorative. Thy lips are warm! Lead, boy: which way? Yea, noise? then I'll be brief. O happy dagger! This is thy sheath; there rest, and let me die. This is the place; there where the torch doth burn. The ground is bloody; search about the churchyard. Go, some of you; whoe'er you find, attach. Pitiful sight! here lies the county slain, And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead, Who here hath lain these two days buried. Go, tell the prince, run to the Capulets, Raise up the Montagues, some others search: We see the ground whereon these woes do lie; But the true ground of all these piteous woes We cannot without circumstance descry. Here's Romeo's man; we found him in the churchyard. Hold him in safety, till the prince come hither. Here is a friar, that trembles, sighs, and weeps; We took this mattock and this spade from him, As he was coming from this churchyard side. A great suspicion: stay the friar too. What misadventure is so early up, That calls our person from our morning's rest? What should it be, that they so shriek abroad? The people in the street cry Romeo, Some Juliet, and some Paris; and all run With open outcry toward our monument. What fear is this which startles in our ears? Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain; And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before, Warm and new kill'd. Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes. Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man; With instruments upon them, fit to open These dead men's tombs. O, heaven!â€”O wife! look how our daughter bleeds! This dagger hath mista'en!â€”for, lo, his house Is empty on the back of Montagueâ€” And is mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom. O me! this sight of death is as a bell, That warns my old age to a sepulchre. Come, Montague: for thou art early up, To see thy son and heir more early down. Alas! my liege, my wife is dead to-night; Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath. What further woe conspires against mine age? Look, and thou shalt see. O thou untaught! what manners is in this, To press before thy father to a grave? Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while, Till we can clear these ambiguities, And know their spring, their head, their true descent; And then will I be general of your woes, And lead you even to death: meantime forbear, And let mischance be slave to patience. Bring forth the parties of suspicion. I am the greatest, able to do least, Yet most suspected, as the time and place Doth make against me, of this direful murder; And here I stand, both to impeach and purge Myself condemned and myself excus'd. Then say at once what thou dost know in this. I will be brief, for my short date of breath Is not so long as is a tedious tale. Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet; And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife: I married them; and their stolen marriage-day Was Tybalt's doomsday, whose untimely death Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from this city; For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin'd. You, to remove that siege of grief from her, Betroth'd, and would have married her perforce, To County Paris: then comes she to me, And, with wild looks bid me devise some mean To rid her from this second marriage, Or in my cell there would she kill herself. Then gave I her,â€”so tutor'd by my art,â€” A sleeping potion; which so took effect As I intended, for it wrought on her The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo That he should hither come as this dire night, To help to take her from her borrow'd grave, Being the time the potion's force should cease. But he which bore my letter, Friar John, Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight Return'd my letter back. Then, all alone, At the prefixed hour of her waking, Came I to take her from her kindred's vault, Meaning to keep her closely at my cell, Till I conveniently could send to Romeo: But, when I came,â€”some minute ere the time Of her awakening,â€”here untimely lay The noble Paris and true Romeo dead. She wakes; and I entreated her come forth, And bear this work of heaven with patience; But then a noise did scare me from the tomb, And she, too desperate, would not go with me, But, as it seems, did violence on herself. All this I know; and to the marriage Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this Miscarried by my fault, let my old life Be sacrific'd, some hour before his time, Unto the rigour of severest law. We still have known thee for a holy man. Where's Romeo's man? what can he say in this? I brought my master news of Juliet's death; And then in post he came from Mantua To this same place, to this same monument. This letter he early bid me give his father, And threaten'd me with death, going in the vault, If I departed not and left him there. Give me the letter; I will look on it. Where is the county's page that rais'd the watch? Sirrah, what made your master in this place? He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave, And bid me stand aloof, and so I did; Anon, comes one with light to ope the tomb; And by and by my master drew on him; And then I ran away to call the watch. This letter doth make good the friar's words, Their course of love, the tidings of her death: And here he writes that he did buy a poison Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet. Where be these enemies?â€”Capulet! Montague! See what a scourge is laid upon your hate, That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love; And I, for winking at your discords too, Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd. O brother Montague! give me thy hand: This is my daughter's jointure, for no more Can I demand. But I can give thee more; For I will raise her statue in pure gold; That while Verona by that name is known. There shall no figure at such rate be set As that of true and faithful Juliet. As rich shall Romeo by his lady lie; Poor sacrifices of our enmity! A glooming peace this morning with it brings; The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head: Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things: Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished: For never was a story of more woe Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.\n"

      "Ghost of Hamlet's Father. Who's there? Nay, answer me; stand, and unfold yourself. Long live the king! Bernardo? He. You come most carefully upon your hour. 'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco. For this relief much thanks; 'tis bitter cold, And I am sick at heart. Have you had quiet guard? Not a mouse stirring. Well, good-night. If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus, The rivals of my watch, bid them make hasie. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there? Friends to this ground. And liegemen to the Dane. Give you good-night. O! farewell, honest soldier: Who hath reliev'd you? Bernardo has my place. Give you good-night. Holla! Bernardo! Say, What! is Horatio there? A piece of him. Welcome, Horatio; welcome, good Marcellus. What! has this thing appear'd again to-night? I have seen nothing. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy, And will not let belief take hold of him Touching this dreaded sight twice seen of us: Therefore I have entreated him along With us to watch the minutes of this night; That if again this apparition come, He may approve our eyes and speak to it. Tush, tush! 'twill not appear. Sit down awhile, And let us once again assail your ears, That are so fortified against our story, What we two nights have seen. Well, sit we down, And let us hear Bernardo speak of this. Last night of all, When yond same star that's westward from the pole Had made his course to illume that part of heaven Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself, The bell then beating one,â€” Peace! break thee off; look, where it comes again! In the same figure, like the king that's dead. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio. Looks it not like the king? mark it, Horatio. Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder. It would be spoke to. Question it, Horatio. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night, Together with that fair and war-like form In which the majesty of buried Denmark Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak! It is offended. See! it stalks away. Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak! 'Tis gone, and will not answer. How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale: Is not this something more than fantasy? What think you on 't? Before my God, I might not this believe Without the sensible and true avouch Of mine own eyes. Is it not like the king? As thou-art to thyself: Such was the very armour he had on When he the ambitious Norway combated; So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle, He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice. 'Tis strange. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour, With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch. In what particular thought to work I know not; But in the gross and scope of my opinion, This bodes some strange eruption to our state. Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows, Why this same strict and most observant watch So nightly toils the subject of the land; And why such daily cast of brazen cannon, And foreign mart for implements of war; Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task Does not divide the Sunday from the week; What might be toward, that this sweaty haste Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day: Who is 't that can inform me? That can I; At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king, Whose image even but now appear'd to us, Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway, Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride, Dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamletâ€” For so this side of our known world esteem'd himâ€” Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact, Well ratified by law and heraldry, Did forfeit with his life all those his lands Which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror; Against the which, a moiety competent Was gaged by our king; which had return'd To the inheritance of Fortinbras, Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant, And carriage of the article design'd, His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras, Of unimproved mettle hot and full, Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes, For food and diet, to some enterprise That hath a stomach in 't; which is no otherâ€” As it doth well appear unto our stateâ€” But to recover of us, by strong hand And terms compulsative, those foresaid lands So by his father lost. And this, I take it, Is the main motive of our preparations, The source of this our watch and the chief head Of this post-haste and romage in the land. I think it be no other but e'en so; Well may it sort that this portentous figure Comes armed through our watch, so like the king That was and is the question of these wars. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye. In the most high and palmy state of Rome, A little ere the mightiest Julius fell, The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets; As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood, Disasters in the sun; and the moist star Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse; And even the like precurse of fierce events, As harbingers preceding still the fates And prologue to the omen coming on, Have heaven and earth together demonstrated Unto our climatures and countrymen. But, soft! behold! lo! where it comes again. I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion! If thou hast any sound, or use of voice, Speak to me: If there be any good thing to be done, That may to thee do ease and grace to me, Speak to me: If thou art privy to thy country's fate, Which happily foreknowing may avoid, O! speak; Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life Extorted treasure in the womb of earth, For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death, Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus. Shall I strike at it with my partisan? Do, if it will not stand. 'Tis here! 'Tis here! 'Tis gone! We do it wrong, being so majestical, To offer it the show of violence; For it is, as the air, invulnerable, And our vain blows malicious mockery. It was about to speak when the cock crew. And then it started like a guilty thing Upon a fearful summons. I have heard, The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn, Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat Awake the god of day; and at his warning, Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air, The extravagant and erring spirit hies To his confine; and of the truth herein This present object made probation. It faded on the crowing of the cock. Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated, The bird of dawning singeth all night long; And then, they say, no spirit can walk abroad; The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike, No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm, So hallow'd and so gracious is the time. So have I heard and do in part believe it. But, look, the morn in russet mantle clad, Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastern hill; Break we our watch up; and by my advice Let us impart what we have seen to-night Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life, This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him. Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it, As needful in our loves, fitting our duty? Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know Where we shall find him most conveniently. Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death The memory be green, and that it us befitted To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom To be contracted in one brow of woe, Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature That we with wisest sorrow think on him, Together with remembrance of ourselves. Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen, The imperial jointress of this war-like state, Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy, With one auspicious and one dropping eye, With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage, In equal scale weighing delight and dole, Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone With this affair along: for all, our thanks. Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras, Holding a weak supposal of our worth, Or thinking by our late dear brother's death Our state to be disjoint and out of frame, Colleagued with the dream of his advantage, He hath not fail'd to pester us with message, Importing the surrender of those lands Lost by his father, with all bands of law, To our most valiant brother. So much for him. Now for ourself and for this time of meeting. Thus much the business is: we have here writ To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras, Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears Of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress His further gait herein; in that the levies, The lists and full proportions, are all made Out of his subject; and we here dispatch You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand, For bearers of this greeting to old Norway, Giving to you no further personal power To business with the king more than the scope Of these delated articles allow. Farewell and let your haste commend your duty. In that and all things will we show our duty. In that and all things will we show our duty. We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell. And now, Laertes, what's the news with you? You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes? You cannot speak of reason to the Dane, And lose your voice; what wouldst thou beg, Laertes, That shall not be my offer, not thy asking? The head is not more native to the heart, The hand more instrumental to the mouth, Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father. What wouldst thou have, Laertes? Dread my lord, Your leave and favour to return to France; From whence though willingly I came to Denmark, To show my duty in your coronation, Yet now, I must confess, that duty done, My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon. Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius? He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave By laboursome petition, and at last Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent: I do beseech you, give him leave to go. Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine, And thy best graces spend it at thy will. But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,â€” A little more than kin, and less than kind. How is it that the clouds still hang on you? Not so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun. Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off, And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark. Do not for ever with thy vailed lids Seek for thy noble father in the dust: Thou know'st 'tis common; all that live must die, Passing through nature to eternity. Ay, madam, it is common. If it be, Why seems it so particular with thee? Seems, madam! Nay, it is; I know not 'seems.' 'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother, Nor customary suits of solemn black, Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath, No, nor the fruitful river in the eye, Nor the dejected haviour of the visage, Together with all forms, modes, shows of grief, That can denote me truly; these indeed seem, For they are actions that a man might play: But I have that within which passeth show; These but the trappings and the suits of woe. 'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet, To give these mourning duties to your father: But, you must know, your father lost a father; That father lost, lost his; and the survivor bound In filial obligation for some term To do obsequious sorrow; but to persever In obstinate condolement is a course Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief: It shows a will most incorrect to heaven, A heart unfortified, a mind impatient, An understanding simple and unschool'd: For what we know must be and is as common As any the most vulgar thing to sense, Why should we in our peevish opposition Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven, A fault against the dead, a fault to nature, To reason most absurd, whose common theme Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried, From the first corse till he that died to-day, 'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth This unprevailing woe, and think of us As of a father; for let the world take note, You are the most immediate to our throne; And with no less nobility of love Than that which dearest father bears his son Do I impart toward you. For your intent In going back to school in Wittenberg, It is most retrograde to our desire; And we beseech you, bend you to remain Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye, Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son. Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet: I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg. I shall in all my best obey you, madam. Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply: Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come; This gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof, No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day, But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell, And the king's rouse the heavens shall bruit again, Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away. O! that this too too solid flesh would melt, Thaw and resolve itself into a dew; Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! O God! How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable Seem to me all the uses of this world. Fie on 't! O fie! 'tis an unweeded garden, That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature Possess it merely. That it should come to this! But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two: So excellent a king; that was, to this, Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother That he might not beteem the winds of heaven Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth! Must I remember? why, she would hang on him, As if increase of appetite had grown By what it fed on; and yet, within a month, Let me not think on't: Frailty, thy name is woman! A little month; or ere those shoes were old With which she follow'd my poor father's body, Like Niobe, all tears; why she, even she,â€” O God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason, Would have mourn'd longer,â€”married with mine uncle, My father's brother, but no more like my father Than I to Hercules: within a month, Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears Had left the flushing in her galled eyes, She married. O! most wicked speed, to post With such dexterity to incestuous sheets. It is not nor it cannot come to good; But break, my heart, for I must hold my tongue! Hail to your lordship! I am glad to see you well: Horatio, or I do forget myself. The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever. Sir, my good friend; I'll change that name with you. And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio? Marcellus? My good lord,â€” I am very glad to see you. Good even, sir. But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg? A truant disposition, good my lord. I would not hear your enemy say so, Nor shall you do mine ear that violence, To make it truster of your own report Against yourself; I know you are no truant. But what is your affair in Elsinore? We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart. My lord, I came to see your father's funeral. I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student; I think it was to see my mother's wedding. Indeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon. Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral bak'd meats Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables. Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven Ere I had ever seen that day, Horatio! My father, methinks I see my father. O! where, my lord? In my mind's eye, Horatio. I saw him once; he was a goodly king. He was a man, take him for all in all, I shall not look upon his like again. My lord, I think I saw him yesternight. Saw who? My lord, the king your father. The king, my father! Season your admiration for a while With an attent ear, till I may deliver, Upon the witness of these gentlemen, This marvel to you. For God's love, let me hear. Two nights together had these gentlemen, Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch, In the dead vast and middle of the night, Been thus encounter'd: a figure like your father, Armed at points exactly, cap-a-pe, Appears before them, and with solemn march Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes, Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distill'd Almost to jelly with the act of fear, Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me In dreadful secrecy impart they did, And I with them the third night kept the watch; Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time, Form of the thing, each word made true and good, The apparition comes. I knew your father; These hands are not more like. But where was this? My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd. Did you not speak to it? My lord, I did; But answer made it none; yet once methought It lifted up its head and did address Itself to motion, like as it would speak; But even then the morning cock crew loud, And at the sound it shrunk in haste away And vanish'd from our sight. 'Tis very strange. As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true; And we did think it writ down in our duty To let you know of it. Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me. Hold you the watch to-night? We do, my lord. We do, my lord. Arm'd, say you? Arm'd, my lord. Arm'd, my lord. From top to toe? My lord, from head to foot. My lord, from head to foot. Then saw you not his face? O yes! my lord; he wore his beaver up. What! look'd he frowningly? A countenance more in sorrow than in anger. Pale or red? Nay, very pale. And fix'd his eyes upon you? Most constantly. I would I had been there. It would have much amaz'd you. Very like, very like. Stay'd it long? While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred. Longer, longer. Longer, longer. Not when I saw it. His beard was grizzled, no? It was, as I have seen it in his life, A sable silver'd. I will watch to-night; Perchance 'twill walk again. I warrant it will. If it assume my noble father's person, I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all, If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight, Let it be tenable in your silence still; And whatsoever else shall hap to-night, Give it an understanding, but no tongue: I will requite your loves. So, fare you well. Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve, I'll visit you. Our duty to your honour. Your loves, as mine to you. Farewell. My father's spirit in arms! all is not well; I doubt some foul play: would the night were come! Till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise, Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes. My necessaries are embark'd; farewell: And, sister, as the winds give benefit And convoy is assistant, do not sleep, But let me hear from you. Do you doubt that? For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour, Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood, A violet in the youth of primy nature, Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting, The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more. No more but so? Think it no more: For nature, crescent, does not grow alone In thews and bulk; but, as this temple waxes, The inward service of the mind and soul Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now, And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch The virtue of his will; but you must fear, His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own, For he himself is subject to his birth; He may not, as unvalu'd persons do, Carve for himself, for on his choice depends The safety and the health of the whole state; And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd Unto the voice and yielding of that body Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you, It fits your wisdom so far to believe it As he in his particular act and place May give his saying deed; which is no further Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal. Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain, If with too credent ear you list his songs, Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open To his unmaster'd importunity. Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister; And keep you in the rear of your affection, Out of the shot and danger of desire. The chariest maid is prodigal enough If she unmask her beauty to the moon; Virtue herself 'scapes not calumnious strokes; The canker galls the infants of the spring Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd, And in the morn and liquid dew of youth Contagious blastments are most imminent. Be wary then; best safety lies in fear: Youth to itself rebels, though none else near. I shall th' effect of this good lesson keep, As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother, Do not, as some ungracious pastors do, Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven, Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine, Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads, And recks not his own rede. O! fear me not. I stay too long; but here my father comes. A double blessing is a double grace; Occasion smiles upon a second leave. Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame! The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail, And you are stay'd for. There, my blessing with thee! And these few precepts in thy memory Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue, Nor any unproportion'd thought his act. Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar; The friends thou hast, and their adoption tried, Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel; But do not dull thy palm with entertainment Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware Of entrance to a quarrel, but, being in, Bear 't that th' opposed may beware of thee. Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice; Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment. Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy, But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy; For the apparel oft proclaims the man, And they in France of the best rank and station Are most select and generous, chief in that. Neither a borrower, nor a lender be; For loan oft loses both itself and friend, And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry. This above all: to thine own self be true, And it must follow, as the night the day, Thou canst not then be false to any man. Farewell; my blessing season this in thee! Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord. The time invites you; go, your servants tend. Farewell, Ophelia; and remember well What I have said to you. 'Tis in my memory lock'd, And you yourself shall keep the key of it. Farewell. What is 't, Ophelia, he hath said to you? So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet. Marry, well bethought: 'Tis told me, he hath very oft of late Given private time to you; and you yourself Have of your audience been most free and bounteous. If it be so,â€”as so 'tis put on me, And that in way of caution,â€”I must tell you, You do not understand yourself so clearly As it behoves my daughter and your honour. What is between you? give me up the truth. He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders Of his affection to me. Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl, Unsifted in such perilous circumstance. Do you believe his tenders, as you call them? I do not know, my lord, what I should think. Marry, I'll teach you: think yourself a baby, That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay, Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly; Or,â€”not to crack the wind of the poor phrase, Running it thus,â€”you'll tender me a fool. My lord, he hath importun'd me with love In honourable fashion. Ay, fashion you may call it: go to, go to. And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord, With almost all the holy vows of heaven. Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know, When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter, Giving more light than heat, extinct in both, Even in their promise, as it is a-making, You must not take for fire. From this time Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence; Set your entreatments at a higher rate Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet, Believe so much in him, that he is young, And with a larger tether may he walk Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia, Do not believe his vows, for they are brokers, Not of that dye which their investments show, But mere implorators of unholy suits, Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds, The better to beguile. This is for all: I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth, Have you so slander any moment's leisure, As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet. Look to 't, I charge you; come your ways. I shall obey, my lord. The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold. It is a nipping and an eager air. What hour now? I think it lacks of twelve. No, it is struck. Indeed? I heard it not: then it draws near the season Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk. What does this mean, my lord? The king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse, Keeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring reels; And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down, The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out The triumph of his pledge. Is it a custom? Ay, marry, is 't: But to my mind,â€”though I am native here And to the manner born,â€”it is a custom More honour'd in the breach than the observance. This heavy-headed revel east and west Makes us traduc'd and tax'd of other nations; They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase Soil our addition; and indeed it takes From our achievements, though perform'd at height, The pith and marrow of our attribute. So, oft it chances in particular men, That for some vicious mole of nature in them, As, in their birth,â€”wherein they are not guilty, Since nature cannot choose his origin,â€” By the o'ergrowth of some complexion, Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason, Or by some habit that too much o'er-leavens The form of plausive manners; that these men, Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect, Being nature's livery, or fortune's star, Their virtues else, be they as pure as grace, As infinite as man may undergo, Shall in the general censure take corruption From that particular fault: the dram of eale Doth all the noble substance of a doubt, To his own scandal. Look, my lord, it comes. Angels and ministers of grace defend us! Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd, Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell, Be thy intents wicked or charitable, Thou com'st in such a questionable shape That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet, King, father; royal Dane, O! answer me: Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death, Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre, Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd, Hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws, To cast thee up again. What may this mean, That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel Revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon, Making night hideous; and we fools of nature So horridly to shake our disposition With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls? Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we do? It beckons you to go away with it, As if it some impartment did desire To you alone. Look, with what courteous action It waves you to a more removed ground: But do not go with it. No, by no means. It will not speak; then, will I follow it. Do not, my lord. Why, what should be the fear? I do not set my life at a pin's fee; And for my soul, what can it do to that, Being a thing immortal as itself? It waves me forth again; I'll follow it. What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord, Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff That beetles o'er his base into the sea, And there assume some other horrible form, Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason And draw you into madness? think of it; The very place puts toys of desperation, Without more motive, into every brain That looks so many fathoms to the sea And hears it roar beneath. It waves me still. Go on, I'll follow thee. You shall not go, my lord. Hold off your hands! Be rul'd; you shall not go. My fate cries out, And makes each petty artery in this body As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve. Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen, By heaven! I'll make a ghost of him that lets me: I say, away! Go on, I'll follow thee. He wares desperate with imagination. Let's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him. Have after. To what issue will this come? Something is rotten in the state of Denmark. Heaven will direct it. Nay, let's follow him. Whither wilt thou lead me? speak; I'll go no further. Mark me. I will. My hour is almost come, When I to sulphurous and tormenting flames Must render up myself. Alas! poor ghost. Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing To what I shall unfold. Speak; I am bound to hear. So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear. What? I am thy father's spirit; Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night, And for the day confin'd to fast in fires, Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature Are burnt and purg'd away. But that I am forbid To tell the secrets of my prison-house, I could a tale unfold whose lightest word Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood, Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres, Thy knotted and combined locks to part, And each particular hair to stand an end, Like quills upon the fretful porpentine: But this eternal blazon must not be To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O list! If thou didst ever thy dear father loveâ€” O God! Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder. Murder! Murder most foul, as in the best it is; But this most foul, strange, and unnatural. Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift As meditation or the thoughts of love, May sweep to my revenge. I find thee apt; And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf, Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear: 'Tis given out that, sleeping in mine orchard, A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark Is by a forged process of my death Rankly abus'd; but know, thou noble youth, The serpent that did sting thy father's life Now wears his crown. O my prophetic soul! My uncle! Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast, With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,â€” O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power So to seduce!â€”won to his shameful lust The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen. O Hamlet! what a falling-off was there; From me, whose love was of that dignity That it went hand in hand even with the vow I made to her in marriage; and to decline Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor To those of mine! But virtue, as it never will be mov'd, Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven, So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd, Will sate itself in a celestial bed, And prey on garbage. But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air; Brief let me be. Sleeping within mine orchard, My custom always in the afternoon, Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole, With juice of cursed hebona in a vial, And in the porches of mine ears did pour The leperous distilment; whose effect Holds such an enmity with blood of man That swift as quicksilver it courses through The natural gates and alleys of the body, And with a sudden vigour it doth posset And curd, like eager droppings into milk, The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine; And a most instant tetter bark'd about, Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust, All my smooth body. Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand, Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd; Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin, Unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd, No reckoning made, but sent to my account With all my imperfections on my head: O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible! If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not; Let not the royal bed of Denmark be A couch for luxury and damned incest. But, howsoever thou pursu'st this act, Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive Against thy mother aught; leave her to heaven, And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge, To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once! The glow-worm shows the matin to be near, And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire; Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me. O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else? And shall I couple hell? O fie! Hold, hold, my heart! And you, my sinews, grow not instant old, But bear me stiffly up! Remember thee! Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat In this distracted globe. Remember thee! Yea, from the table of my memory I'll wipe away all trivial fond records, All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past, That youth and observation copied there; And thy commandment all alone shall live Within the book and volume of my brain, Unmix'd with baser matter: yes, by heaven! O most pernicious woman! O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain! My tables,â€”meet it is I set it down, That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain; At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmark: So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word; It is, 'Adieu, adieu! remember me. I have sworn 't. My lord! my lord! Lord Hamlet! Heaven secure him! So be it! Hillo, ho, ho, my lord! Hillo, ho, ho, boy! come, bird, come. How is't, my noble lord? What news, my lord? O! wonderful. Good my lord, tell it. No; you will reveal it. Not I, my lord, by heaven! Nor I, my lord. How say you, then; would heart of man once think it? But you'll be secret? Ay, by heaven, my lord. Ay, by heaven, my lord. There's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark, But he's an arrant knave. There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave, To tell us this. Why, right; you are i' the right; And so, without more circumstance at all, I hold it fit that we shake hands and part; You, as your business and desire shall point you,â€” For every man hath business and desire, Such as it is,â€”and, for mine own poor part, Look you, I'll go pray. These are but wild and whirling words, my lord. I am sorry they offend you, heartily; Yes, faith, heartily. There's no offence, my lord. Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio, And much offence, too. Touching this vision here, It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you; For your desire to know what is between us, O'ermaster't as you may. And now, good friends, As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers, Give me one poor request. What is't, my lord? we will. Never make known what you have seen to-night. My lord, we will not. My lord, we will not. Nay, but swear't. In faith, My lord, not I. Nor I, my lord, in faith. Upon my sword. We have sworn, my lord, already. Indeed, upon my sword, indeed. Swear. Ah, ha, boy! sayst thou so? art thou there, true-penny? Come on,â€”you hear this fellow in the cellar-age,â€” Consent to swear. Propose the oath, my lord. Never to speak of this that you have seen, Swear by my sword. Swear. Hic et ubique? then we'll shift our ground. Come hither, gentlemen, And lay your hands again upon my sword: Never to speak of this that you have heard, Swear by my sword. Swear. Well said, old mole! canst work i' the earth so fast? A worthy pioner! once more remove, good friends. O day and night, but this is wondrous strange! And therefore as a stranger give it welcome. There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. But come; Here, as before, never, so help you mercy, How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself, As I perchance hereafter shall think meet To put an antic disposition on, That you, at such times seeing me, never shall, With arms encumber'd thus, or this head-shake, Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase, As, 'Well, well, we know,' or, 'We could, an if we would;' Or, 'If we list to speak,' or, 'There be, an if they might;' Or such ambiguous giving out, to note That you know aught of me: this not to do, So grace and mercy at your most need help you, Swear. Swear. Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! So, gentlemen, With all my love I do commend me to you: And what so poor a man as Hamlet is May do, to express his love and friending to you, God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together; And still your fingers on your lips, I pray. The time is out of joint; O cursed spite, That ever I was born to set it right! Nay, come, let's go together. Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo. I will, my lord. You shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo, Before you visit him, to make inquiry Of his behaviour. My lord, I did intend it. Marry, well said, very well said. Look you, sir, Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris; And how, and who, what means, and where they keep, What company, at what expense; and finding By this encompassment and drift of question That they do know my son, come you more nearer Than your particular demands will touch it: Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him; As thus, 'I know his father, and his friends, And, in part, him;' do you mark this, Reynaldo? Ay, very well, my lord. 'And, in part, him; but,' you may say, 'not well: But if't be he I mean, he's very wild, Addicted so and so;' and there put on him What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank As may dishonour him; take heed of that; But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips As are companions noted and most known To youth and liberty. As gaming, my lord? Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling, Drabbing; you may go so far. My lord, that would dishonour him. Faith, no; as you may season it in the charge. You must not put another scandal on him, That he is open to incontinency; That's not my meaning; but breathe his faults so quaintly That they may seem the taints of liberty, The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind, A savageness in unreclaimed blood, Of general assault. But, my good lord,â€” Wherefore should you do this? Ay, my lord, I would know that. Marry, sir, here's my drift; And, I believe, it is a fetch of warrant: You laying these slight sullies on my son, As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' the working, Mark you, Your party in converse, him you would sound, Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes The youth you breathe of guilty, be assur'd, He closes with you in this consequence; 'Good sir,' or so; or 'friend,' or 'gentleman,' According to the phrase or the addition Of man and country. Very good, my lord. And then, sir, does he this,â€”he does,â€”what was I about to say? By the mass I was about to say something: where did I leave? At 'closes in the consequence.' At 'friend or so,' and 'gentleman.' At 'closes in the consequence,' ay, marry; He closes with you thus: 'I know the gentleman; I saw him yesterday, or t' other day, Or then, or then; with such, or such; and, as you say, There was a' gaming; there o'ertook in 's rouse; There falling out at tennis;' or perchance, 'I saw him enter such a house of sale,' Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth. See you now; Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth; And thus do we of wisdom and of reach, With windlasses, and with assays of bias, By indirections find directions out: So by my former lecture and advice Shall you my son. You have me, have you not? My lord, I have. God be wi' you; fare you well. Good my lord! Observe his inclination in yourself. I shall, my lord. And let him ply his music. Well, my lord. Farewell! How now, Ophelia! what's the matter? Alas! my lord, I have been so affrighted. With what, in the name of God? My lord, as I was sewing in my closet, Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbrac'd; No hat upon his head; his stockings foul'd, Ungarter'd, and down-gyved to his ancle; Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other; And with a look so piteous in purport As if he had been loosed out of hell To speak of horrors, he comes before me. Mad for thy love? My lord, I do not know; But truly I do fear it. What said he? He took me by the wrist and held me hard, Then goes he to the length of all his arm, And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow, He falls to such perusal of my face As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so; At last, a little shaking of mine arm, And thrice his head thus waving up and down, He rais'd a sigh so piteous and profound That it did seem to shatter all his bulk And end his being. That done, he lets me go, And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd, He seem'd to find his way without his eyes; For out o' doors he went without their help, And to the last bended their light on me. Come, go with me; I will go seek the king. This is the very ecstasy of love, Whose violent property fordoes itself And leads the will to desperate undertakings As oft as any passion under heaven That does afflict our natures. I am sorry. What! have you given him any hard words of late? No, my good lord; but, as you did command, I did repel his letters and denied His access to me. That hath made him mad. I am sorry that with better heed and judgment I had not quoted him; I fear'd he did but trifle, And meant to wrack thee; but, beshrew my jealousy! By heaven, it is as proper to our age To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions As it is common for the younger sort To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king: This must be known; which, being kept close, might move More grief to hide than hate to utter love. Come. Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern! Moreover that we much did long to see you, The need we have to use you did provoke Our hasty sending. Something have you heard Of Hamlet's transformation; so I call it, Since nor the exterior nor the inward man Resembles that it was. What it should be More than his father's death, that thus hath put him So much from the understanding of himself, I cannot dream of: I entreat you both, That, being of so young days brought up with him, And since so neighbour'd to his youth and humour, That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court Some little time; so by your companies To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather, So much as from occasion you may glean, Whe'r aught to us unknown afflicts him thus, That, open'd, lies within our remedy. Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you; And sure I am two men there are not living To whom he more adheres. If it will please you To show us so much gentry and good will As to expend your time with us awhile, For the supply and profit of our hope, Your visitation shall receive such thanks As fits a king's remembrance. Both your majesties Might, by the sovereign power you have of us, Put your dread pleasures more into command Than to entreaty. But we both obey, And here give up ourselves, in the full bent, To lay our service freely at your feet, To be commanded. Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern. Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz; And I beseech you instantly to visit My too much changed son. Go, some of you, And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is. Heavens make our presence, and our practices Pleasant and helpful to him! Ay, amen! The ambassadors from Norway, my good lord, Are joyfully return'd. Thou still hast been the father of good news. Have I, my lord? Assure you, my good liege, I hold my duty, as I hold my soul, Both to my God and to my gracious king; And I do thinkâ€”or else this brain of mine Hunts not the trail of policy so sure As it hath us'd to doâ€”that I have found The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy. O! speak of that; that do I long to hear. Give first admittance to the ambassadors; My news shall be the fruit to that great feast. Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in. He tells me, my sweet queen, that he hath found The head and source of all your son's distemper. I doubt it is no-other but the main; His father's death, and our o'erhasty marriage. Well, we shall sift him. Welcome, my good friends! Say, Voltimand, what from our brother Norway? Most fair return of greetings, and desires. Upon our first, he sent out to suppress His nephew's levies, which to him appear'd To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack; But, better look'd into, he truly found It was against your highness: whereat griev'd, That so his sickness, age, and impotence Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys, Receives rebuke from Norway, and, in fine, Makes vow before his uncle never more To give the assay of arms against your majesty. Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy, Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee, And his commission to employ those soldiers, So levied as before, against the Polack; With an entreaty, herein further shown, That it might please you to give quiet pass Through your dominions for this enterprise, On such regards of safety and allowance As therein are set down. It likes us well; And at our more consider'd time we'll read, Answer, and think upon this business: Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour. Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together: Most welcome home. This business is well ended. My liege, and madam, to expostulate What majesty should be, what duty is, Why day is day, night night, and time is time, Were nothing but to waste night, day, and time. Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit, And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes, I will be brief. Your noble son is mad: Mad call I it; for, to define true madness, What is 't but to be nothing else but mad? But let that go. More matter, with less art. Madam, I swear I use no art at all. That he is mad, 'tis true; 'tis true 'tis pity; And pity 'tis 'tis true: a foolish figure; But farewell it, for I will use no art. Mad let us grant him, then; and now remains That we find out the cause of this effect, Or rather say, the cause of this defect, For this effect defective comes by cause; Thus it remains, and the remainder thus. Perpend. I have a daughter, have while she is mine; Who, in her duty and obedience, mark, Hath given me this: now, gather, and surmise. \"To the celestial, and my soul's idol, the most beautified Ophelia.â€”\" That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is a vile phrase; but you shall hear. Thus: In her excellent white bosom, these, &c.â€” Came this from Hamlet to her? Good madam, stay awhile; I will be faithful. \"Doubt thou the stars are fire; Doubt that the sun doth move; Doubt truth to be a liar; But never doubt I love. O dear Ophelia! I am ill at these numbers: I have not art to reckon my groans; but that I love thee best, O most best! believe it. Adieu. Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to him,HAMLET.\" This in obedience hath my daughter shown me; And more above, hath his solicitings, As they fell out by time, by means, and place, All given to mine ear. But how hath she Receiv'd his love? What do you think of me? As of a man faithful and honourable. I would fain prove so. But what might you think, When I had seen this hot love on the wing,â€” As I perceiv'd it, I must tell you that, Before my daughter told me,â€”what might you, Or my dear majesty, your queen here, think, If I had play'd the desk or table-book, Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb, Or look'd upon this love with idle sight; What might you think? No, I went round to work, And my young mistress thus I did bespeak: 'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star; This must not be:' and then I precepts gave her, That she should lock herself from his resort, Admit no messengers, receive no tokens. Which done, she took the fruits of my advice; And he, repulsed,â€”a short tale to make,â€” Fell into a sadness, then into a fast, Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness, Thence to a lightness; and by this declension Into the madness wherein now he raves, And all we wail for. Do you think 'tis this? It may be, very likely. Hath there been such a time,â€”I'd fain know that,â€” That I have positively said, ''Tis so,' When it prov'd otherwise? Not that I know. Take this from this, if this be otherwise: If circumstances lead me, I will find Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed Within the centre. How may we try it further? You know sometimes he walks four hours together Here in the lobby. So he does indeed. At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him; Be you and I behind an arras then; Mark the encounter; if he love her not, And be not from his reason fallen thereon, Let me be no assistant for a state, But keep a farm, and carters. We will try it. But look, where sadly the poor wretch comes reading. Away! I do beseech you, both away. I'll board him presently. O! give me leave. How does my good Lord Hamlet? Well, God a-mercy. Do you know me, my lord? Excellent well; you are a fishmonger. Not I, my lord. Then I would you were so honest a man. Honest, my lord! Ay, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man picked out of ten thousand. That's very true, my lord. For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a good kissing carrion,â€”Have you a daughter? I have, my lord. Let her not walk i' the sun: conception is a blessing; but not as your daughter may conceive. Friend, look to 't. How say you by that? Still harping on my daughter: yet he knew me not at first; he said I was a fishmonger: he is far gone, far gone: and truly in my youth I suffered much extremity for love; very near this. I'll speak to him again. What do you read, my lord? Words, words, words. What is the matter, my lord? Between who? I mean the matter that you read, my lord. Slanders, sir: for the satirical rogue says here that old men have grey beards, that their faces are wrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber and plum-tree gum, and that they have a plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams: all which, sir, though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down; for you yourself, sir, should be old as I am, if, like a crab, you could go backward. Though this be madness, yet there is method in 't. Will you walk out of the air, my lord? Into my grave? Indeed, that is out o' the air. How pregnant sometimes his replies are! a happiness that often madness hits on, which reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of. I will leave him, and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between him and my daughter. My honourable lord, I will most humbly take my leave of you. You cannot, sir, take from me any thing that I will more willingly part withal; except my life, except my life, except my life. Fare you well, my lord. These tedious old fools! You go to seek the Lord Hamlet; there he is. God save you, sir! Mine honoured lord! My most dear lord! My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern? Ah, Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both? As the indifferent children of the earth. Happy in that we are not over happy; On Fortune's cap we are not the very button. Nor the soles of her shoe? Neither, my lord. Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her favours? Faith, her privates we. In the secret parts of Fortune? O! most true; she is a strumpet. What news? None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest. Then is doomsday near; but your news is not true. Let me question more in particular: what have you, my good friends, deserved at the hands of Fortune, that she sends you to prison hither? Prison, my lord! Denmark's a prison. Then is the world one. A goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and dungeons, Denmark being one o' the worst. We think not so, my lord. Why, then, 'tis none to you; for there is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so: to me it is a prison. Why, then your ambition makes it one; 'tis too narrow for your mind. O God! I could be bounded in a nutshell, and count myself a king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams. Which dreams, indeed, are ambition, for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream. A dream itself is but a shadow. Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadow's shadow. Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretched heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we to the court? for, by my fay, I cannot reason. We'll wait upon you. We'll wait upon you. No such matter; I will not sort you with the rest of my servants, for, to speak to you like an honest man, I am most dreadfully attended. But, in the beaten way of friendship, what make you at Elsinore? To visit you, my lord; no other occasion. Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you: and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come, come, deal justly with me: come, come; nay, speak. What should we say, my lord? Why anything, but to the purpose. You were sent for; and there is a kind of confession in your looks which your modesties have not craft enough to colour: I know the good king and queen have sent for you. To what end, my lord? That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear a better proposer could charge you withal, be even and direct with me, whether you were sent for or no! What say you? Nay, then, I have an eye of you. If you love me, hold not off. My lord, we were sent for. I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the king and queen moult no feather. I have of late,â€”but wherefore I know not,â€”lost all my mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the earth, seems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to me but a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What a piece of work is a man! How noble in reason! how infinite in faculty! in form, in moving, how express and admirable! in action how like an angel! in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me, what is this quintessence of dust? man delights not me; no, nor woman neither, though, by your smiling, you seem to say so. My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts. Why did you laugh then, when I said, 'man delights not me?' To think, my lord; if you delight not in man, what lenten entertainment the players shall receive from you: we coted them on the way; and hither are they coming, to offer you service. He that plays the king shall be welcome; his majesty shall have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target; the lover shall not sigh gratis; the humorous man shall end his part in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickle o' the sere; and the lady shall say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt for't. What players are they? Even those you were wont to take delight in, the tragedians of the city. How chances it they travel? their residence, both in reputation and profit, was better both ways. I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation. Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the city? Are they so followed? No, indeed they are not. How comes it? Do they grow rusty? Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace: but there is, sir, an aery of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top of question, and are most tyrannically clapped for't: these are now the fashion, and so berattle the common stages,â€”so they call them,â€”that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose-quills, and dare scarce come thither. What! are they children? who maintains 'em? how are they escoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing? will they not say afterwards, if they should grow themselves to common players,â€”as it is most like, if their means are no better,â€”their writers do them wrong, to make them exclaim against their own succession? Faith, there has been much to-do on both sides: and the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy: there was, for a while, no money bid for argument, unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question. Is it possible? O! there has been much throwing about of brains. Do the boys carry it away? Ay, that they do, my lord; Hercules and his load too. It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark, and those that would make mows at him while my father lived, give twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats a-piece for his picture in little. 'Sblood, there is something in this more than natural, if philosophy could find it out. There are the players. Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come then; the appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony: let me comply with you in this garb, lest my extent to the playersâ€”which, I tell you, must show fairly outwardâ€”should more appear like entertainment than yours. You are welcome; but my uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived. In what, my dear lord? I am but mad north-north-west: when the wind is southerly I know a hawk from a handsaw. Well be with you, gentlemen! Hark you, Guildenstern; and you too; at each ear a hearer: that great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling-clouts. Happily he's the second time come to them; for they say an old man is twice a child. I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players; mark it. You say right, sir; o' Monday morning; 'twas so indeed. My lord, I have news to tell you. My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an actor in Rome,â€” The actors are come hither, my lord. Buzz, buzz! Upon my honour,â€” Then came each actor on his ass,â€” The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral, scene individable, or poem unlimited: Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty, these are the only men. O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou! What a treasure had he, my lord? Why One fair daughter and no more, The which he loved passing well. Still on my daughter. Am I not i' the right, old Jephthah? If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I love passing well. Nay, that follows not. What follows, then, my lord? Why, As by lot, God wot. And then, you know, It came to pass, as most like it was.â€” The first row of the pious chanson will show you more; for look where my abridgment comes. You are welcome, masters; welcome, all. I am glad to see thee well: welcome, good friends. O, my old friend! Thy face is valanced since I saw thee last: comest thou to beard me in Denmark? What! my young lady and mistress! By 'r lady, your ladyship is nearer heaven than when I saw you last, by the altitude of a chopine. Pray God, your voice, like a piece of uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the ring. Masters, you are all welcome. We'll e'en to't like French falconers, fly at anything we see: we'll have a speech straight. Come, give us a taste of your quality; come, a passionate speech. What speech, my good lord? I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted; or, if it was, not above once; for the play, I remember, pleased not the million; 'twas caviare to the general: but it wasâ€”as I received it, and others, whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mineâ€”an excellent play, well digested in the scenes, set down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember one said there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury, nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of affectation; but called it an honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One speech in it I chiefly loved; 'twas Ã†neas' tale to Dido; and thereabout of it especially, where he speaks of Priam's slaughter. If it live in your memory, begin at this line: let me see, let me see:â€” Therugged Pyrrhus, like the Hyrcanian beast,â€” 'tis not so, it begins with Pyrrhus:â€” The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arm, Black as his purpose, did the night resemble When he lay couched in the ominous horse, Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd With heraldry more dismal; head to foot Now is he total gules; horridly trick'd With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons, Bak'd and impasted with the parching streets, That lend a tyrannous and damned light To their vile murders: rousted in wrath and fire, And thus o'er-sized with coagulate gore, With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus Old grandsire Priam seeks. So proceed you. 'Fore God, my lord, well spoken; with good accent and good discretion. Anon, he finds him Striking too short at Greeks; his antique sword, Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls, Repugnant to command. Unequal match'd, Pyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide; But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword The unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium, Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear: for lo! his sword, Which was declining on the milky head Of rever end Priam, seem'd i' the air to stick: So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood, And like a neutral to his will and matter, Did nothing. But, as we often see, against some storm, A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still, The bold winds speechless and the orb below As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder Doth rend the region; so, after Pyrrhus' pause, Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work; And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall On Mars's armour, forg'd for proof eterne, With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword Now falls on Priam. Out, out, thou strumpet, Fortune! All you gods, In general synod, take away her power; Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel, And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven, As low as to the fiends! This is too long. It shall to the barber's, with your beard. Prithee, say on: he's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps. Say on; come to Hecuba. But who, O! who had seen the mobled queenâ€” 'The mobled queen?'â€” That's good; 'mobled queen' is good. Run barefoot up and down, threat'ning the flames With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head Where late the diadem stood; and, for a robe, About her lank and all o'er-teemed loins, A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up; Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd, 'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have pronounc'd: But if the gods themselves did see her then, When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport In mincing with his sword her husband's limbs, The instant burst of clamour that she madeâ€” Unless things mortal move them not at allâ€” Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven, And passion in the gods. Look! wh'er he has not turned his colour and has tears in's eyes. Prithee, no more. 'Tis well; I'll have thee speak out the rest soon. Good my lord, will you see the players well bestowed? Do you hear, let them be well used; for they are the abstracts and brief chronicles of the time: after your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while you live. My lord, I will use them according to their desert. God's bodikins, man, much better; use every man after his desert, and who should 'scape whipping? Use them after your own honour and dignity: the less they deserve, the more merit is in your bounty. Take them in. Come, sirs. Follow him, friends: we'll hear a play to-morrow. Dost thou hear me, old friend; can you play the Murder of Gonzago? Ay, my lord. We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need, study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines, which I would set down and insert in't, could you not? Ay, my lord. Very well. Follow that lord; and look you mock him not. My good friends, I'll leave you till night; you are welcome to Elsinore. Good my lord! Ay, so, God be wi' ye! Now I am alone. O! what a rogue and peasant slave am I: Is it not monstrous that this player here, But in a fiction, in a dream of passion, Could force his soul so to his own conceit That from her working all his visage wann'd, Tears in his eyes, distraction in 's aspect, A broken voice, and his whole function suiting With forms to his conceit? and all for nothing! For Hecuba! What 's Hecuba to him or he to Hecuba That he should weep for her? What would he do Had he the motive and the cue for passion That I have? He would drown the stage with tears, And cleave the general ear with horrid speech, Make mad the guilty and appal the free, Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I, A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak, Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause, And can say nothing; no, not for a king, Upon whose property and most dear life A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward? Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across? Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face? Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i' the throat, As deep as to the lungs? Who does me this? Ha! Swounds, I should take it, for it cannot be But I am pigeon-liver'd, and lack gall To make oppression bitter, or ere this I should have fatted all the region kites With this slave's offal. Bloody, bawdy villain! Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain! O! vengeance! Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave That I, the son of a dear father murder'd, Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell, Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words, And fall a-cursing, like a very drab, A scullion! Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! I have heard, That guilty creatures sitting at a play Have by the very cunning of the scene Been struck so to the soul that presently They have proclaim'd their malefactions; For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak With most miraculous organ. I'll have these players Play something like the murder of my father Before mine uncle; I'll observe his looks; I'll tent him to the quick: if he but blench I know my course. The spirit that I have seen May be the devil: and the devil hath power To assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps Out of my weakness and my melancholyâ€” As he is very potent with such spiritsâ€” Abuses me to damn me. I'll have grounds More relative than this: the play 's the thing Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king. And can you, by no drift of circumstance, Get from him why he puts on this confusion, Grating so harshly all his days of quiet With turbulent and dangerous lunacy? He does confess he feels himself distracted; But from what cause he will by no means speak. Nor do we find him forward to be sounded, But, with a crafty madness, keeps aloof, When we would bring him on to some confession Of his true state. Did he receive you well? Most like a gentleman. But with much forcing of his disposition. Niggard of question, but of our demands Most free in his reply. Did you assay him To any pastime? Madam, it so fell out that certain players We o'er-raught on the way; of these we told him, And there did seem in him a kind of joy To hear of it: they are about the court, And, as I think, they have already order This night to play before him. 'Tis most true; And he beseech'd me to entreat your majesties To hear and see the matter. With all my heart; and it doth much content me To hear him so inclin'd. Good gentlemen, give him a further edge, And drive his purpose on to these delights. We shall, my lord. Sweet Gertrude, leave us too; For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither, That he, as 'twere by accident, may here Affront Ophelia. Her father and myself, lawful espials, Will so bestow ourselves, that, seeing, unseen, We may of their encounter frankly judge, And gather by him, as he is behav'd, If 't be the affliction of his love or no That thus he suffers for. I shall obey you. And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish That your good beauties be the happy cause Of Hamlet's wildness; so shall I hope your virtues Will bring him to his wonted way again, To both your honours. Madam, I wish it may. Ophelia, walk you here. Gracious, so please you, We will bestow ourselves. Read on this book; That show of such an exercise may colour Your loneliness. We are oft to blame in this, 'Tis too much prov'd, that with devotion's visage And pious action we do sugar o'er The devil himself. O! 'tis too true; How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience! The harlot's cheek, beautied with plastering art, Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it Than is my deed to my most painted word: O heavy burden! I hear him coming; let's withdraw, my lord. To be, or not to be: that is the question: Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep; No more; and, by a sleep to say we end The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep; To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub; For in that sleep of death what dreams may come When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, Must give us pause. There's the respect That makes calamity of so long life; For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely, The pangs of dispriz'd love, the law's delay, The insolence of office, and the spurns That patient merit of the unworthy takes, When he himself might his quietus make With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear, To grunt and sweat under a weary life, But that the dread of something after death, The undiscover'd country from whose bourn No traveller returns, puzzles the will, And makes us rather bear those ills we have Than fly to others that we know not of? Thus conscience does make cowards of us all; And thus the native hue of resolution Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought, And enterprises of great pith and moment With this regard their currents turn awry, And lose the name of action. Soft you now! The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons Be all my sins remember'd. Good my lord, How does your honour for this many a day? I humbly thank you; well, well, well. My lord, I have remembrances of yours, That I have longed long to re-deliver; I pray you, now receive them. No, not I; I never gave you aught. My honour'd lord, you know right well you did; And, with them, words of so sweet breath compos'd As made the things more rich: their perfume lost, Take these again; for to the noble mind Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind. There, my lord. Ha, ha! are you honest? My lord! Are you fair? What means your lordship? That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty. Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty? Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness: this was sometime a paradox, but now the time gives it proof. I did love thee once. Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so. You should not have believed me; for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it: I loved you not. I was the more deceived. Get thee to a nunnery: why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest; but yet I could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me. I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious; with more offences at my beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give them shape, or time to act them in. What should such fellows as I do crawling between heaven and earth? We are arrant knaves, all; believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery. Where's your father? At home, my lord. Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool nowhere but in's own house. Farewell. O! help him, you sweet heavens! If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy dowry: be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a nunnery, go; farewell. Or, if thou wilt needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go; and quickly too. Farewell. O heavenly powers, restore him! I have heard of your paintings too, well enough; God hath given you one face, and you make yourselves another: you jig, you amble, and you lisp, and nickname God's creatures, and make your wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't; it hath made me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages; those that are married already, all but one, shall live; the rest shall keep as they are. To a nunnery, go. O! what a noble mind is here o'erthrown: The courtier's, soldier's, scholar's, eye, tongue, sword; The expectancy and rose of the fair state, The glass of fashion and the mould of form, The observ'd of all observers, quite, quite down! And I, of ladies most deject and wretched, That suck'd the honey of his music vows, Now see that noble and most sovereign reason, Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh; That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth Blasted with ecstasy: O! woe is me, To have seen what I have seen, see what I see! Love! his affections do not that way tend; Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little, Was not like madness. There's something in his soul O'er which his melancholy sits on brood; And, I do doubt, the hatch and the disclose Will be some danger; which for to prevent, I have in quick determination Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England, For the demand of our neglected tribute: Haply the seas and countries different With variable objects shall expel This something-settled matter in his heart, Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus From fashion of himself. What think you on't? It shall do well: but yet do I believe The origin and commencement of his grief Sprung from neglected love. How now, Ophelia! You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said; We heard it all. My lord, do as you please; But, if you hold it fit, after the play, Let his queen mother all alone entreat him To show his griefs: let her be round with him; And I'll be plac'd, so please you, in the ear Of all their conference. If she find him not, To England send him, or confine him where Your wisdom best shall think. It shall be so: Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go. Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you, trippingly on the tongue; but if you mouth it, as many of your players do, I had as lief the town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air too much with your hand, thus; but use all gently: for in the very torrent, tempest, andâ€”as I may sayâ€”whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget a temperance, that may give it smoothness. O! it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwigpated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to very rage, to split the ears of the groundlings, who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb-shows and noise: I would have such a fellow whipped for o'er-doing Termagant; it out-herods Herod: pray you, avoid it. I warrant your honour. Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion be your tutor: suit the action to the word, the word to the action; with this special observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of nature; for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as 'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature, scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure. Now, this overdone, or come tardy off, though it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the censure of which one must in your allowance o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O! there be players that I have seen play, and heard others praise, and that highly, not to speak it profanely, that, neither having the accent of Christians nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of nature's journeymen had made men and not made them well, they imitated humanity so abominably. I hope we have reformed that indifferently with us. O! reform it altogether. And let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them; for there be of them that will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too, though in the mean time some necessary question of the play be then to be considered; that's villanous, and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it. Go, make you ready. How now, my lord! will the king hear this piece of work? And the queen too, and that presently. Bid the players make haste. Will you two help to hasten them? We will, my lord. We will, my lord. What, ho! Horatio! Here, sweet lord, at your service. Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man As e'er my conversation cop'd withal. O! my dear lord,â€” Nay, do not think I flatter; For what advancement may I hope from thee, That no revenue hast but thy good spirits To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd? No; let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp, And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear? Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice And could of men distinguish, her election Hath seal'd thee for herself; for thou hast been As one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing, A man that fortune's buffets and rewards Hast ta'en with equal thanks; and bless'd are those Whose blood and judgment are so well comingled That they are not a pipe for fortune's finger To sound what stop she please. Give me that man That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart, As I do thee. Something too much of this. There is a play to-night before the king; One scene of it comes near the circumstance Which I have told thee of my father's death: I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot, Even with the very comment of thy soul Observe mine uncle; if his occulted guilt Do not itself unkennel in one speech, It is a damned ghost that we have seen, And my imaginations are as foul As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note; For I mine eyes will rivet to his face, And after we will both our judgments join In censure of his seeming. Well, my lord: If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing, And 'scape detecting, I will pay the theft. They are coming to the play; I must be idle: Get you a place. How fares our cousin Hamlet? Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish: I eat the air, promise-crammed; you cannot feed capons so. I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet; these words are not mine. No, nor mine now. My lord, you played once i' the university, you say? That did I, my lord, and was accounted a good actor. And what did you enact? I did enact Julius CÃ¦sar: I was killed i' the Capitol; Brutus killed me. It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there. Be the playcrs ready? Ay, my lord; they stay upon your patience. Come hither, my good Hamlet, sit by me. No, good mother, here's metal more attractive. O ho! do you mark that? Lady, shall I lie in your lap? No, my lord. I mean, my head upon your lap? Ay, my lord. Do you think I meant country matters? I think nothing, my lord. That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs. What is, my lord? Nothing. You are merry, my lord. Who, I? Ay, my lord. O God, your only jig-maker. What should a man do but be merry? for, look you, how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father died within's two hours. Nay, 'tis twice two months, my lord. So long? Nay, then, let the devil wear black, for I'll have a suit of sables. O heavens! die two months ago, and not forgotten yet? Then there's hope a great man's memory may outlive his life half a year; but, by'r lady, he must build churches then, or else shall he suffer not thinking on, with the hobby-horse, whose epitaph is, 'For, O! for, O! the hobby-horse is forgot.' What means this, my lord? Marry, this is miching mallecho; it means mischief. Belike this show imports the argument of the play. We shall know by this fellow: the players cannot keep counsel; they'll tell all. Will he tell us what this show meant? Ay, or any show that you'll show him; be not you ashamed to show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means. You are naught, you are naught. I'll mark the play. For us and for our tragedy, Here stooping to your clemency, We beg your hearing patiently. Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring? 'Tis brief, my lord. As woman's love. Full thirty times hath PhÅ“bus' cart gone round Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground, And thirty dozen moons with borrow'd sheen About the world have times twelve thirties been, Since love our hearts and Hymen did our hands Unite commutual in most sacred bands. So many journeys may the sun and moon Make us again count o'er ere love be done! But, woe is me! you are so sick of late, So far from cheer and from your former state, That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust, Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must; For women's fear and love holds quantity, In neither aught, or in extremity. Now, what my love is, proof hath made you know; And as my love is siz'd, my fear is so. Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear; Where little fears grow great, great love grows there. Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too; My operant powers their functions leave to do: And thou shall live in this fair world behind, Honour'd, belov'd; and haply one as kind For husband shalt thouâ€” O! confound the rest; Such love must needs be treason in my breast: In second husband let me be accurst: None wed the second but who kill'd the first. Wormwood, wormwood. The instances that second marriage move, Are base respects of thrift, but none of love; A second time I kill my husband dead, When second husband kisses me in bed. I do believe you think what now you speak; But what we do determine oft we break. Purpose is but the slave to memory, Of violent birth, but poor validity; Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree, But fall unshaken when they mellow be. Most necessary 'tis that we forget To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt; What to ourselves in passion we propose, The passion ending, doth the purpose lose. The violence of either grief or joy Their own enactures with themselves destroy; Where joy most revels grief doth most lament, Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident. This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange, That even our love should with our fortunes change; For 'tis a question left us yet to prove Whe'r love lead fortune or else fortune love. The great man down, you mark his favourite flies; The poor advanc'd makes friends of enemies. And hitherto doth love on fortune tend, For who not needs shall never lack a friend; And who in want a hollow friend doth try Directly seasons him his enemy. But, orderly to end where I begun, Our wills and fates do so contrary run That our devices still are overthrown, Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own: So think thou wilt no second husband wed; But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light! Sport and repose lock from me day and night! To desperation turn my trust and hope! An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope! Each opposite that blanks the face of joy Meet what I would have well, and it destroy! Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife, If, once a widow, ever I be wife! If she should break it now! 'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile; My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile The tedious day with sleep. Sleep rock thy brain; And never come mischance between us twain! Madam, how like you this play? The lady doth protest too much, methinks. O! but she'll keep her word. Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in 't? No, no, they do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i' the world. What do you call the play? The Mouse-trap. Marry, how? Tropically. This play is the image of a murder done in Vienna: Gonzago is the duke's name; his wife, Baptista. You shall see anon; 'tis a knavish piece of work: but what of that? your majesty and we that have free souls, it touches us not: let the galled jade wince, our withers are unwrung. This is one Lucianus, nephew to the king. You are a good chorus, my lord. I could interpret between you and your love, if I could see the puppets dallying. You are keen, my lord, you are keen. It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge. Still better, and worse. So you must take your husbands. Begin, murderer; pox, leave thy damnable faces, and begin. Come; the croaking raven doth bellow for revenge. Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing; Confederate season, else no creature seeing; Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected, With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected, Thy natural magic and dire property, On wholesome life usurp immediately. He poisons him i' the garden for's estate. Hisname's Gonzago; the story is extant, and writ in very choice Italian. You shall see anon how the murderer gets the love of Gonzago's wife. The king rises. What! frighted with false fire? How fares my lord? Give o'er the play. Give me some light: away! Lights, lights, lights! Why, let the stricken deer go weep, The hart ungalled play; For some must watch, while some must sleep: So runs the world away. Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers, if the rest of my fortunes turn Turk with me, with two Provincial roses on my razed shoes, get me a fellowship in a cry of players, sir? Half a share. A whole one, I. For thou dost know, O Damon dear, This realm dismantled was Of Jove himself; and now reigns here A very, veryâ€”pajock. You might have rimed. O good Horatio! I'll take the ghost's word for a thousand pound. Didst perceive? Very well, my lord. Upon the talk of the poisoning? I did very well note him. Ah, ha! Come, some music! come, the recorders! For if the king like not the comedy, Why then, belike he likes it not, perdy. Come, some music! Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you. Sir, a whole history. The king, sir,â€” Ay, sir, what of him? Is in his retirement marvellous distempered. With drink, sir? No, my lord, rather with choler. Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to his doctor; for, for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps plunge him into far more choler. Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame, and start not so wildly from my affair. I am tame, sir; pronounce. The queen, your mother, in most great affliction of spirit, hath sent me to you. You are welcome. Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right breed. If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer, I will do your mother's commandment; if not, your pardon and my return shall be the end of my business. Sir, I cannot. What, my lord? Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseased; but, sir, such answer as I can make, you shall command; or, rather, as you say, my mother: therefore no more, but to the matter: my mother, you say,â€” Then, thus she says: your behaviour hath struck her into amasement and admiration. O wonderful son, that can so astonish a mother! But is there no sequel at the heels of this mother's admiration? Impart. She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to bed. We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you any further trade with us? My lord, you once did love me. So I do still, by these pickers and stealers. Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? you do surely bar the door upon your own liberty, if you deny your griefs to your friend. Sir, I lack advancement. How can that be when you have the voice of the king himself for your succession in Denmark? Ay, sir, but 'While the grass grows,'â€”the proverb is something musty. O! the recorders: let me see one. To withdraw with you: why do you go about to recover the wind of me, as if you would drive me into a toil? O! my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too unmannerly. I do not well understand that. Will you play upon this pipe? My lord, I cannot. I pray you. Believe me, I cannot. I do beseech you. I know no touch of it, my lord. 'Tis as easy as lying; govern these ventages with your finger and thumb, give it breath with your mouth, and it will discourse most eloquent music. Look you, these are the stops. But these cannot I command to any utterance of harmony; I have not the skill. Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me. You would play upon me; you would seem to know my stops; you would pluck out the heart of my mystery; you would sound me from my lowest note to the top of my compass; and there is much music, excellent voice, in this little organ, yet cannot you make it speak. 'Sblood, do you think I am easier to be played on than a pipe? Call me what instrument you will, though you can fret me, you cannot play upon me. God bless you, sir! My lord, the queen would speak with you, and presently. Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel? By the mass, and 'tis like a camel, indeed. Methinks it is like a weasel. It is backed like a weasel. Or like a whale? Very like a whale. Then I will come to my mother by and by They fool me to the top of my bent. I will come by and by. I will say so. By and by is easily said. Leave me, friends. 'Tis now the very witching time of night, When churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out Contagion to this world: now could I drink hot blood, And do such bitter business as the day Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother. O heart! lose not thy nature; let not ever The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom; Let me be cruel, not unnatural; I will speak daggers to her, but use none; My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites; How in my words soever she be shent, To give them seals never, my soul, consent! I like him not, nor stands it safe with us To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you; I your commission will forth with dispatch, And he to England shall along with you. The terms of our estate may not endure Hazard so dangerous as doth hourly grow Out of his lunacies. We will ourselves provide. Most holy and religious fear it is To keep those many many bodies safe That live and feed upon your majesty. The single and peculiar life is bound With all the strength and armour of the mind To keep itself from noyance; but much more That spirit upon whose weal depend and rest The lives of many. The cease of majesty Dies not alone, but, like a gulf doth draw What's near it with it; it is a massy wheel, Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount, To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things Are mortis'd and adjoin'd; which, when it falls, Each small annexment, petty consequence, Attends the boisterous ruin. Never alone Did the king sigh, but with a general groan. Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage; For we will fetters put upon this fear, Which now goes too free-footed. We will haste us. We will haste us. My lord, he's going to his mother's closet: Behind the arras I'll convey myself To hear the process; I'll warrant she'll tax him home; And, as you said, and wisely was it said, 'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother, Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege: I'll call upon you ere you go to bed And tell you what I know. Thanks, dear my lord. O! my offence is rank, it smells to heaven; It hath the primal eldest curse upon't; A brother's murder! Pray can I not, Though inclination be as sharp as will: My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent; And, like a man to double business bound, I stand in pause where I shall first begin, And both neglect. What if this cursed hand Were thicker than itself with brother's blood, Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy But to confront the visage of offence? And what's in prayer but this two-fold force, To be forestalled, ere we come to fall, Or pardon'd, being down? Then, I'll look up; My fault is past. But, O! what form of prayer Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murder?' That cannot be; since I am still possess'd Of those effects for which I did the murder, My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen. May one be pardon'd and retain the offence? In the corrupted currents of this world Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice, And oft 'tis seen the wicked prise itself Buys out the law; but 'tis not so above; There is no shuffling, there the action lies In his true nature, and we ourselves compell'd Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults To give in evidence. What then? what rests? Try what repentance can: what can it not? Yet what can it, when one can not repent? O wretched state! O bosom black as death! O limed soul, that struggling to be free Art more engaged! Help, angels! make assay; Bow, stubborn knees; and heart with strings of steel Be soft as sinews of the new-born babe. All may be well. Now might I do it pat, now he is praying; And now I'll do't: and so he goes to heaven; And so am I reveng'd. That would be scann'd: A villain kills my father; and for that, I, his sole son, do this same villain send To heaven. Why, this is hire and salary, not revenge. He took my father grossly, full of bread, With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May; And how his audit stands who knows save heaven? But in our circumstance and course of thought 'Tis heavy with him. And am I then reveng'd, To take him in the purging of his soul, When he is fit and season'd for his passage? No. Up, sword, and know thou a more horrid hent; When he is drunk asleep, or in his rage, Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed, At gaming, swearing, or about some act That has no relish of salvation in't; Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven, And that his soul may be as damn'd and black As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays: This physic but prolongs thy sickly days. My words fly up, my thoughts remain below: Words without thoughts never to heaven go. He will come straight. Look you lay home to him; Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with, And that your Grace hath screen'd and stood between Much heat and him. I'll silence me e'en here. Pray you, be round with him. Mother, mother, mother! I'll warrant you; Fear me not. Withdraw, I hear him coming. Now, mother, what's the matter? Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended. Mother, you have my father much offended. Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue. Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue. Why, how now, Hamlet! What's the matter now? Have you forgot me? No, by the rood, not so: You are the queen, your husband's brother's wife; And,â€”would it were not so!â€”you are my mother. Nay then, I'll set those to you that can speak. Come, come, and sit you down; you shall not budge; You go not, till I set you up a glass Where you may see the inmost part of you. What wilt thou do? thou wilt not murder me? Help, help, ho! What, ho! help! help! help! How now! a rat? Dead, for a ducat, dead! O! I am slain. O me! what hast thou done? Nay, I know not: is it the king? O! what a rash and bloody deed is this! A bloody deed! almost as bad, good mother, As kill a king, and marry with his brother. As kill a king! Ay, lady, 'twas my word. Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell! I took thee for thy better; take thy fortune; Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger. Leave wringing of your hands: peace! sit you down, And let me wring your heart; for so I shall If it be made of penetrable stuff, If damned custom have not brass'd it so That it is proof and bulwark against sense What have I done that thou dar'st wag thy tongue In noise so rude against me? Such an act That blurs the grace and blush of modesty, Calls virtue hypocrite, takes off the rose From the fair forehead of an innocent love And sets a blister there, makes marriage vows As false as dicers' oaths; O! such a deed As from the body of contraction plucks The very soul, and sweet religion makes A rhapsody of words; heaven's face doth glow, Yea, this solidity and compound mass, With tristful visage, as against the doom, Is thought-sick at the act. Ay me! what act, That roars so loud and thunders in the index? Look here, upon this picture, and on this; The counterfeit presentment of two brothers. See, what a grace was seated on this brow; Hyperion's curls, the front of Jove himself, An eye like Mars, to threaten and command, A station like the herald Mercury New-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill, A combination and a form indeed, Where every god did seem to set his seal, To give the world assurance of a man. This was your husband: look you now, what follows. Here is your husband; like a mildew'd ear, Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes? Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed, And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes? You cannot call it love, for at your age The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble, And waits upon the judgment; and what judgment Would step from this to this? Sense, sure, you have, Else could you not have motion; but sure, that sense Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err, Nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thrall'd But it reserv'd some quantity of choice, To serve in such a difference. What devil was 't That thus hath comen'd you at hoodman-blind? Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight, Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all, Or but a sickly part of one true sense Could not so mope. O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell, If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones, To flaming youth let virtue be as wax, And melt in her own fire: proclaim no shame When the compulsive ardour gives the charge, Since first itself as actively doth burn, And reason panders will. O Hamlet! speak no more; Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul; And there I see such black and grained spots As will not leave their tinct. Nay, but to live In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed, Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love Over the nasty sty,â€” O! speak to me no more; These words like daggers enter in mine ears; No more, sweet Hamlet! A murderer, and a villain; A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings; A cut-purse of the empire and the rule, That from a shelf the precious diadem stole, And put it in his pocket! No more! A king of shreds and patches,â€” Save me, and hover o'er me with your wings, You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure? Alas! he's mad! Do you not come your tardy son to chide, That, laps'd in time and passion, lets go by The important acting of your dread command? O! say. Do not forget: this visitation Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose. But, look! amazement on thy mother sits; O! step between her and her fighting soul; Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works: Speak to her, Hamlet. How is it with you, lady? Alas! how is't with you, That you do bend your eye on vacancy And with the incorporal air do hold discourse? Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep; And, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm, Your bedded hair, like life in excrements, Starts up and stands an end. O gentle son! Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper Sprinkle cool patience. Whereon do you look? On him, on him! Look you, how pale he glares! His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones, Would make them capable. Do not look upon me; Lest with this piteous action you convert My stern effects: then what I have to do Will want true colour; tears perchance for blood. To whom do you speak this? Do you see nothing there? Nothing at all; yet all that is I see. Nor did you nothing hear? No, nothing but ourselves. Why, look you there! look, how it steals away; My father, in his habit as he liv'd; Look! where he goes, even now, out at the portal. This is the very coinage of your brain: This bodiless creation ecstasy Is very cunning in. Ecstasy! My pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep time, And makes as healthful music. It is not madness That I have utter'd: bring me to the test, And I the matter will re-word, which madness Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace, Lay not that flattering unction to your soul, That not your trespass but my madness speaks; It will but skin and film the ulcerous place, Whiles rank corruption, mining all within, Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven; Repent what's past; avoid what is to come; And do not spread the compost on the weeds To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue; For in the fatness of these pursy times Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg, Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good. O Hamlet! thou hast cleft my heart in twain. O! throw away the worser part of it, And live the purer with the other half. Good night; but go not to mine uncle's bed; Assume a virtue, if you have it not. That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat, Of habits devil, is angel yet in this, That to the use of actions fair and good He likewise gives a frock or livery, That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night; And that shall lend a kind of easiness To the next abstinence: the next more easy; For use almost can change the stamp of nature, And master ev'n the devil or throw him out With wondrous potency. Once more, goodnight: And when you are desirous to be bless'd, I'll blessing beg of you. For this same lord, I do repent: but heaven hath pleas'd it so, To punish me with this, and this with me, That I must be their scourge and minister. I will bestow him, and will answer well The death I gave him. So, again, good-night. I must be cruel only to be kind: Thus bad begins and worse remains behind. One word more, good lady. What shall I do? Not this, by no means, that I bid you do: Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed; Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse; And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses, Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers, Make you to ravel all this matter out, That I essentially am not in madness, But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know; For who that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise, Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib, Such dear concernings hide? who would do so? No, in despite of sense and secrecy, Unpeg the basket on the house's top, Let the birds fly, and, like the famous ape, To try conclusions, in the basket creep, And break your own neck down. Be thou assur'd, if words be made of breath, And breath of life, I have no life to breathe What thou hast said to me. I must to England; you know that? Alack! I had forgot: 'tis so concluded on. There's letters seal'd; and my two schoolfellows, Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd, They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way, And marshal me to knavery. Let it work; For 'tis the sport to have the enginer Hoist with his own petar: and it shall go hard But I will delve one yard below their mines, And blow them at the moon. O! 'tis most sweet, When in one line two crafts directly meet. This man shall set me packing; I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room. Mother, good-night. Indeed this counsellor Is now most still, most secret, and most grave, Who was in life a foolish prating knave. Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you. Good-night, mother. There's matter in these sighs, these profound heaves: You must translate; 'tis fit we understand them. Where is your son? Bestow this place on us a little while. Ah! my good lord, what have I seen to-night. What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet? Mad as the sea and wind, when both contend Which is the mightier. In his lawless fit, Behind the arras hearing something stir, Whips out his rapier, cries, 'A rat! a rat!' And, in his brainish apprehension, kills The unseen good old man. O heavy deed! It had been so with us had we been there. His liberty is full of threats to all; To you yourself, to us, to every one. Alas! how shall this bloody deed be answer'd? It will be laid to us, whose providence Should have kept short, restrain'd, and out of haunt, This mad young man: but so much was our love, We would not understand what was most fit, But, like the owner of a foul disease, To keep it from divulging, let it feed Even on the pith of life. Where is he gone? To draw apart the body he hath kill'd; O'er whom his very madness, like some ore Among a mineral of metals base, Shows itself pure: he weeps for what is done. O Gertrude! come away. The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch But we will ship him hence; and this vile deed We must, with all our majesty and skill, Both countenance and excuse. Ho! Guildenstern! Friends both, go join you with some further aid: Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain, And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him: Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body Into the chapel. I pray you, haste in this. Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends; And let them know both what we mean to do, And what's untimely done: so, haply, slander, Whose whisper o'er the world's diameter, As level as the cannon to his blank Transports his poison'd shot, may miss our name, And hit the woundless air. O! come away; My soul is full of discord and dismay. Safely stowed. Hamlet! Lord Hamlet! Hamlet! Lord Hamlet! What noise? who calls on Hamlet? O! here they come. What have you done, my lord, with the dead body? Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin. Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence And bear it to the chapel. Do not believe it. Believe what? That I can keep your counsel and not mine own. Besides, to be demanded of a sponge! what replication should be made by the son of a king? Take you me for a sponge, my lord? Ay, sir, that soaks up the king's countenance, his rewards, his authorities. But such officers do the king best service in the end: he keeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his jaw; first mouthed, to be last swallowed: when he needs what you have gleaned, it is but squeezing you, and, sponge, you shall be dry again. I understand you not, my lord. I am glad of it: a knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear. My lord, you must tell us where the body is, and go with us to the king. The body is with the king, but the king is not with the body. The king is a thingâ€” A thing, my lord! Of nothing: bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after. I have sent to seek him, and to find the body. How dangerous is it that this man goes loose! Yet must not we put the strong law on him: He's lov'd of the distracted multitude, Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes; And where 'tis so, the offender's scourge is weigh'd, But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even, This sudden sending him away must seem Deliberate pause: diseases desperate grown By desperate appliance are reliev'd, Or not at all. How now! what hath befall'n? Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord, We cannot get from him. But where is he? Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure. Bring him before us. Ho, Guildenstern! bring in my lord. Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius? At supper. At supper! Where? Not where he eats, but where he is eaten: a certain convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your worm is your only emperor for diet: we fat all creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves for maggots: your fat king and your lean beggar is but variable service; two dishes, but to one table: that's the end. Alas, alas! A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and eat of the fish that hath fed of that worm. What dost thou mean by this? Nothing, but to show you how a king may go a progress through the guts of a beggar. Where is Polonius? In heaven; send thither to see: if your messenger find him not there, seek him i' the other place yourself. But, indeed, if you find him not within this month, you shall nose him as you go up the stairs into the lobby. Go seek him there. He will stay till you come. Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety, Which we do tender, as we dearly grieve For that which thou hast done, must send thee hence With fiery quickness: therefore prepare thyself; The bark is ready, and the wind at help, The associates tend, and every thing is bent For England. For England! Ay, Hamlet. Good. So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes. I see a cherub that sees them. But, come; for England! Farewell, dear mother. Thy loving father, Hamlet. My mother: father and mother is man and wife, man and wife is one flesh, and so, my mother. Come, for England! Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard: Delay it not, I'll have him hence to-night. Away! for every thing is seal'd and done That else leans on the affair: pray you, make haste. And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught,â€” As my great power thereof may give thee sense, Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red After the Danish sword, and thy free awe Pays homage to us,â€”thou mayst not coldly set Our sovereign process, which imports at full, By letters conjuring to that effect, The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England; For like the hectic in my blood he rages, And thou must cure me. Till I know 'tis done, Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun. Go, captain, from me greet the Danish king; Tell him that, by his licence, Fortinbras Claims the conveyance of a promis'd march Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous. If that his majesty would aught with us, We shall express our duty in his eye, And let him know so. I will do 't, my lord. Go softly on. Good sir, whose powers are these? They are of Norway, sir. How purpos'd, sir, I pray you? Against some part of Poland. Who commands them, sir? The nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras. Goes it against the main of Poland, sir, Or for some frontier? Truly to speak, and with no addition, We go to gain a little patch of ground That hath in it no profit but the name. To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it; Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee. Why, then the Polack never will defend it. Yes, 'tis already garrison'd. Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats Will not debate the question of this straw: This is the imposthume of much wealth and peace, That inward breaks, and shows no cause without Why the man dies. I humbly thank you, sir. God be wi' you, sir. Will 't please you go, my lord? I'll be with you straight. Go a little before. How all occasions do inform against me, And spur my dull revenge! What is a man, If his chief good and market of his time Be but to sleep and feed? a beast, no more. Sure he that made us with such large discourse, Looking before and after, gave us not That capability and god-like reason To fust in us unus'd. Now, whe'r it be Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple Of thinking too precisely on the event, A thought, which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom, And ever three parts coward, I do not know Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do;' Sith I have cause and will and strength and means To do 't. Examples gross as earth exhort me: Witness this army of such mass and charge Led by a delicate and tender prince, Whose spirit with divine ambition puff'd Makes mouths at the invisible event, Exposing what is mortal and unsure To all that fortune, death and danger dare, Even for an egg-shell. Rightly to be great Is not to stir without great argument, But greatly to find quarrel in a straw When honour's at the stake. How stand I then, That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd, Excitements of my reason and my blood, And let all sleep, while, to my shame, I see The imminent death of twenty thousand men, That, for a fantasy and trick of fame, Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause, Which is not tomb enough and continent To hide the slaim? O! from this time forth, My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth! I will not speak with her. She is importunate, indeed distract: Her mood will needs be pitied. What would she have? She speaks much of her father; says she hears There's tricks i' the world; and hems, and beats her heart; Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt, That carry but half sense: her speech is nothing, Yet the unshaped use of it doth move The hearers to collection; they aim at it, And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts; Which, as her winks, and nods, and gestures yield them, Indeed would make one think there might be thought, Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily. 'Twere good she were spoken with, for she may strew Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds. Let her come in. To my sick soul, as sin's true nature is, Each toy seems prologue to some great amiss: So full of artless jealousy is guilt, It spills itself in fearing to be spilt. Where is the beauteous majesty of Denmark? How now, Ophelia! How should I your true love know From another one? By his cockle hat and staff, And his sandal shoon. Alas! sweet lady, what imports this song? Say you? nay, pray you, mark. He is dead and gone, lady, He is dead and gone; At his head a grass-green turf; At his heals a stone. O, ho! Nay, but Ophelia,â€” Pray you, mark. White his shroud as the mountain snow,â€” Alas! look here, my lord. Larded with sweet flowers; Which bewept to the grave did go With true-love showers. How do you, pretty lady? Well, God 'ild you! They say the owl was a baker's daughter. Lord! we know what we are, but know not what we may be. God be at your table! Conceit upon her father. Pray you, let's have no words of this; but when they ask you what it means, say you this: To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day, All in the morning betime, And I a maid at your window, To be your Valentine: Then up he rose, and donn'd his clothes, And dupp'd the chamber door; Let in the maid, that out a maid Never departed more. Pretty Ophelia! Indeed, la! without an oath, I'll make an end on 't: By Gis and by Saint Charity, Alack, and fie for shame! Young men will do't, if they come to't; By Cock they are to blame. Quoth she, before you tumbled me, You promis'd me to wed: So would I ha' done, by yonder sun, An thou hadst not come to my bed. How long hath she been thus? I hope all will be well. We must be patient: but I cannot choose but weep, to think they should lay him i' the cold ground. My brother shall know of it: and so I thank you for your good counsel. Come, my coach! Good-night, ladies; good-night, sweet ladies; good-night, good-night. Follow her close; give her good watch, I pray you. O! this is the poison of deep grief; it springs All from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude! When sorrows come, they come not single spies, But in battalions. First, her father slain; Next, your son gone; but he most violent author Of his own just remove: the people muddied, Thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers, For good Polonius' death; and we have done but greenly, In hugger-mugger to inter him: poor Ophelia Divided from herself and her fair judgment, Without the which we are pictures, or mere beasts: Last, and as much containing as all these, Her brother is in secret come from France, Feeds on his wonder, keeps himself in clouds, And wants not buzzers to infect his ear With pestilent speeches of his father's death; Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd, Will nothing stick our person to arraign In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude! this, Like to a murdering-piece, in many places Gives me superfluous death. Alack! what noise is this? Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door. What is the matter? Save yourself, my lord; The ocean, overpeering of his list, Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste Than young Laertes, in a riotous head, O'erbears your officers. The rabble call him lord; And, as the world were now but to begin, Antiquity forgot, custom not known, The ratifiers and props of every word, They cry, 'Choose we; Laertes shall be king!' Caps, hands, and tongues, applaud it to the clouds, 'Laertes shall be king, Laertes king!' How cheerfully on the false trail they cry! O! this is counter, you false Danish dogs! The doors are broke. Where is the king? Sirs, stand you all without. No, let's come in. I pray you, give me leave. We will, we will. I thank you: keep the door. O thou vile king! Give me my father. Calmly, good Laertes. That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard, Cries cuckold to my father, brands the harlot Even here, between the chaste unsmirched brow Of my true mother. What is the cause, Laertes, That thy rebellion looks so giant-like? Let him go, Gertrude; do not fear our person: There's such divinity doth hedge a king, That treason can but peep to what it would, Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes, Why thou art thus incens'd. Let him go, Gertrude. Speak, man. Where is my father? Dead. But not by him. Let him demand his fill. How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with. To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil! Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit! I dare damnation. To this point I stand, That both the worlds I give to negligence, Let come what comes; only I'll be reveng'd Most throughly for my father. Who shall stay you? My will, not all the world: And, for my means, I'll husband them so well, They shall go far with little. Good Laertes, If you desire to know the certainty Of your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge, That, swoopstake, you will draw both friend and foe, Winner and loser? None but his enemies. Will you know them then? To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms; And like the kind life-rendering pelican, Repast them with my blood. Why, now you speak Like a good child and a true gentleman. That I am guiltless of your father's death, And am most sensibly in grief for it, It shall as level to your judgment pierce As day does to your eye. Let her come in. How now! what noise is that? O heat, dry up my brains! tears seven times salt, Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye; By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight, Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May! Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia! O heavens! is't possible a young maid's wits Should be as mortal as an old man's life? Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine It sends some precious instance of itself After the thing it loves. They bore him barefac'd on the bier; Hey non nonny, nonny, hey nonny; And in his grave rain'd many a tear;â€” Fare you well, my dove! Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge, It could not move thus. You must sing, a-down a-down, And you call him a-down-a. O how the wheel becomes it! It is the false steward that stole his master's daughter. This nothing's more than matter. There's rosemary, that's for remembrance; brance; pray, love, remember: and there is pansies, that's for thoughts. A document in madness, thoughts and remembrance fitted. There's fennel for you, and columbines; there's rue for you; and here's some for me; we may call it herb of grace o' Sundays. O! you must wear your rue with a difference. There's a daisy; I would give you some violets, but they withered all when my father died. They say he made a good end,â€” For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy. Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself, She turns to favour and to prettiness. And will he not come again? And will he not come again? No, no, he is dead; Go to thy death-bed, He never will come again. His beard was as white as snow All fiaxen was his poll, He is gone, he is gone, And we cast away moan: God ha' mercy on his soul! And of all Christian souls! I pray God. God be wi' ye! Do you see this, O God? Laertes, I must common with your grief, Or you deny me right. Go but apart, Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will, And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me. If by direct or by collateral hand They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give, Our crown, our life, and all that we call ours, To you in satisfaction; but if not, Be you content to lend your patience to us, And we shall jointly labour with your soul To give it due content. Let this be so: His means of death, his obscure burial, No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones, No noble rite nor formal ostentation, Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth, That I must call 't in question. So you shall; And where the offence is let the great axe fall. I pray you go with me. What are they that would speak with me? Sailors, sir: they say, they have letters for you. Let them come in. I do not know from what part of the world I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet. God bless you, sir. Let him bless thee too. He shall, sir, an't please him. There's a letter for you, sir;â€”it comes from the ambassador that was bound for England;â€”if your name be Horatio, as I am let to know it is. Horatio, when thou shalt have overlooked this, give these fellows some means to the king: they have letters for him. Ere we were two days old at sea, a pirate of very war-like appointment gave us chase. Finding ourselves too slow of sail, we put on a compelled valour; in the grapple I boarded them: on the instant they got clear of our ship, so I alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with me like thieves of mercy, but they knew what they did; I am to do a good turn for them. Let the king have the letters I have sent; and repair thou to me with as much haste as thou wouldst fly death. I have words to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb; yet are they much too light for the bore of the matter. These good fellows will bring thee where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their course for England: of them I have much to tell thee. Farewell. He that thou knowest thine, Come, I will give you way for these your letters; And do 't the speedier, that you may direct me To him from whom you brought them. Now must your conscience my acquittance seal, And you must put me in your heart for friend, Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear, That he which hath your noble father slain Pursu'd my life. It well appears: but tell me Why you proceeded not against these feats, So crimeful and so capital in nature, As by your safety, wisdom, all things else, You mainly were stirr'd up. O! for two special reasons; Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd, But yet to me they are strong. The queen his mother Lives almost by his looks, and for myself,â€” My virtue or my plague, be it either which,â€” She's so conjunctive to my life and soul, That, as the star moves not but in his sphere, I could not but by her. The other motive, Why to a public count I might not go, Is the great love the general gender bear him; Who, dipping all his faults in their affection, Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone, Convert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows, Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind, Would have reverted to my bow again, And not where I had aim'd them. And so have I a noble father lost; A sister driven into desperate terms, Whose worth, if praises may go back again, Stood challenger on mount of all the age For her perfections. But my revenge will come. Break not your sleeps for that; you must not think That we are made of stuff so flat and dull That we can let our beard be shook with danger And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more; I lov'd your father, and we love ourself, And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine,â€” How now! what news? Letters, my lord, from Hamlet: This to your majesty; this to the queen. From Hamlet! who brought them? Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not: They were given me by Claudio, he receiv'd them Of him that brought them. Laertes, you shall hear them. Leave us. High and mighty, you shall know I am set naked on your kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes; when I shall, first asking your pardon thereunto, recount the occasions of my sudden and more strange return What should this mean? Are all the rest come back? Or is it some abuse and no such thing? Know you the hand? 'Tis Hamlet's character. 'Naked,' And in a postscript here, he says, 'alone.' Can you advise me? I'm lost in it, my lord. But let him come: It warms the very sickness in my heart, That I shall live and tell him to his teeth, 'Thus diddest thou.' If it be so, Laertes, As how should it be so? how otherwise? Will you be rul'd by me? Ay, my lord; So you will not o'er-rule me to a peace. To thine own peace. If he be now return'd, As checking at his voyage, and that he means No more to undertake it, I will work him To an exploit, now ripe in my device, Under the which he shall not choose but fall; And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe, But even his mother shall uncharge the practice And call it accident. My lord, I will be rul'd; The rather, if you could devise it so That I might be the organ. It falls right. You have been talk'd of since your travel much, And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality Wherein, they say, you shine; your sum of parts Did not together pluck such envy from him As did that one, and that, in my regard, Of the unworthiest siege. What part is that, my lord? A very riband in the cap of youth, Yet needful too; for youth no less becomes The light and careless livery that it wears Than settled age his sables and his weeds, Importing health and graveness. Two months since Here was a gentleman of Normandy: I've seen myself, and serv'd against, the French, And they can well on horseback; but this gallant Had witchcraft in 't, he grew unto his seat, And to such wondrous doing brought his horse, As he had been incorps'd and demi-natur'd With the brave beast; so far he topp'd my thought, That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks, Come short of what he did. A Norman was 't? A Norman. Upon my life, Lamord. The very same. I know him well; he is the brooch indeed And gem of all the nation. He made confession of you, And gave you such a masterly report For art and exercise in your defence, And for your rapier most especially, That he cried out, 'twould be a sight indeed If one could match you; the scrimers of their nation, He swore, had neither motion, guard, nor eye, If you oppos'd them. Sir, this report of his Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy That he could nothing do but wish and beg Your sudden coming o'er, to play with him. Now, out of this,â€” What out of this, my lord? Laertes, was your father dear to you? Or are you like the painting of a sorrow, A face without a heart? Why ask you this? Not that I think you did not love your father, But that I know love is begun by time, And that I see, in passages of proof, Time qualifies the spark and fire of it. There lives within the very flame of love A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it, And nothing is at a like goodness still, For goodness, growing to a plurisy, Dies in his own too-much. That we would do, We should do when we would, for this 'would' changes, And hath abatements and delays as many As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents; And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh, That hurts by easing. But, to the quick o' the ulcer; Hamlet comes back; what would you undertake To show yourself your father's son in deed More than in words? To cut his throat i' the church. No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize; Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes, Will you do this, keep close within your chamber. Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home; We'll put on those shall praise your excellence, And set a double varnish on the fame The Frenchman gave you, bring you, in fine, together, And wager on your heads: he, being remise, Most generous and free from all contriving, Will not peruse the foils; so that, with ease Or with a little shuffling, you may choose A sword unbated, and, in a pass of practice Requite him for your father. I will do 't; And, for that purpose, I'll anoint my sword. I bought an unction of a mountebank, So mortal that, but dip a knife in it, Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare, Collected from all simples that have virtue Under the moon, can save the thing from death That is but scratch'd withal; I'll touch my point With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly, It may be death. Let's further think of this; Weigh what convenience both of time and means May fit us to our shape. If this should fail, And that our drift look through our bad performance 'Twere better not assay'd; therefore this project Should have a back or second, that might hold, If this should blast in proof. Soft! let me see; We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings: I ha't: When in your motion you are hot and dry,â€” As make your bouts more violent to that end,â€” And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepar'd him A chalice for the nonce, whereon but sipping, If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck, Our purpose may hold there. But stay! what noise? How now, sweet queen! One woe doth tread upon another's heel, So fast they follow: your sister's drown'd, Laertes. Drown'd! O, where? There is a willow grows aslant a brook, That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream; There with fantastic garlands did she come, Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples, That liberal shepherds give a grosser name, But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them: There, on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds Clambering to hang, an envious sliver broke, When down her weedy trophies and herself Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide, And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up; Which time she chanted snatches of old tunes, As one incapable of her own distress, Or like a creature native and indu'd Unto that element; but long it could not be Till that her garments, heavy with their drink, Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay To muddy death. Alas! then, she is drown'd? Drown'd, drown'd. Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelis, And therefore I forbid my tears; but yet It is our trick, nature her custom holds, Let shame say what it will; when these are gone The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord! I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze, But that this folly douts it. Let's follow, Gertrude. How much I had to do to calm his rage! Now fear I this will give it start again; Therefore let's follow. Is she to be buried in Christian burial that wilfully seeks her own salvation? I tell thee she is; and therefore make her grave straight: the crowner hath sat on her, and finds it Christian burial. How can that be, unless she drowned herself in her own defence? Why, 'tis found so. It must be se offendendo; it cannot be else. For here lies the point: if I drown myself wittingly it argues an act; and an act hath three branches; it is, to act, to do, and to perform: argal, she drowned herself wittingly. Nay, but hear you, goodman delver,â€” Give me leave. Here lies the water; good: here stands the man; good: if the man go to this water, and drown himself, it is, will he, nill he, he goes; mark you that? but if the water come to him, and drown him, he drowns not himself: argal, he that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life. But is this law? Ay, marry, is 't; crowner's quest law. Will you ha' the truth on 't? If this had not been a gentlewoman she should have been buried out o' Christian burial. Why, there thou sayest; and the more pity that great folk should have countenance in this world to drown or hang themselves more than their even Christian. Come, my spade. There is no ancient gentlemen but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers; they hold up Adam's profession. Was he a gentleman? A' was the first that ever bore arms. Why, he had none. What! art a heathen? How dost thou understand the Scripture? The Scripture says, Adam digged; could be dig without arms? I'll put another question to thee; if thou answerest me not to the purpose, confess thyselfâ€” Go to. What is he that builds stronger than either the mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter? The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand tenants. I like thy wit well, in good faith; the gallows does well, but how does it well? it does well to those that do ill; now thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the church: argal, the gallows may do well to thee. To 't again; come. Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a carpenter? Ay, tell me that, and unyoke. Marry, now I can tell. To 't. Mass, I cannot tell. Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull ass will not mend his pace with beating; and, when you are asked this question next, say, 'a grave-maker:' the houses that he makes last till doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan; fetch me a stoup of liquor. First Clown digs, and sings. In youth, when I did love, did love, Methought it was very sweet, To contract, O! the time, for-a my behove, O! methought there was nothing meet. Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he sings at grave-making? Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness. 'Tis e'en so; the hand of little employment hath the daintier sense. But age, with his stealing steps, Hath claw'd me in his clutch, And hath shipped me intil the land, As if I had never been such. That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once; how the knave jowls it to the ground, as if it were Cain's jaw-bone, that did the first murder! This might be the pate of a politician, which this ass now o'er-offices, one that would circumvent God, might it not? It might, my lord. Or of a courtier, which could say, 'Good morrow, sweet lord! How dost thou, good lord?' This might be my Lord Such-a-one, that praised my Lord Such-a-one's horse, when he meant to beg it, might it not? Ay, my lord. Why, e'en so, and now my Lady Worm's; chapless, and knocked about the mazzard with a sexton's spade. Here's fine revolution, an we had the trick to see 't. Did these bones cost no more the breeding but to play at loggats with 'em? mine ache to think on 't. A pick-axe, and a spade, a spade, For and a shrouding sheet; O! a pit of clay for to be made For such a guest is meet. There's another; why may not that be the skull of a lawyer? Where be his quiddities now, his quillets, his cases, his tenures, and his tricks? why does he suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him of his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be in 's time a great buyer of land, with his statutes, his recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers, his recoveries; is this the fine of his fines, and the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine pate full of fine dirt? will his vouchers vouch him no more of his purchases, and double ones too, than the length and breadth of a pair of indentures? The very conveyance of his lands will hardly lie in this box, and must the inheritor himself have no more, ha? Not a jot more, my lord. Is not parchment made of sheep-skins? Ay, my lord, and of calf-skins too. They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that. I will speak to this fellow. Whose grave's this, sir? Mine, sir, O! a pit of clay for to be made For such a guest is meet. I think it be thine, indeed; for thou liest in 't. You lie out on 't, sir, and therefore it is not yours; for my part, I do not lie in 't, and yet it is mine. Thou dost lie in 't, to be in 't and say it is thine: 'tis for the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest. 'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away again, from me to you. What man dost thou dig it for? For no man, sir. What woman, then? For none, neither. Who is to be buried in 't? One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's dead. How absolute the knave is! we must speak by the card, or equivocation will undo us. By the Lord, Horatio, these three years I have taken note of it; the age is grown so picked that the toe of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier, he galls his kibe. How long hast thou been a grave-maker? Of all the days i' the year, I came to 't that day that our last King Hamlet overcame Fortinbras. How long is that since? Cannot you tell that? every fool can tell that; it was the very day that young Hamlet was born; he that is mad, and sent into England. Ay, marry; why was he sent into England? Why, because he was mad: he shall recover his wits there; or, if he do not, 'tis no great matter there Why? 'Twill not be seen in him there; there the men are as mad as he. How came he mad? Very strangely, they say. How strangely? Faith, e'en with losing his wits. Upon what ground? Why, here in Denmark; I have been sexton here, man and boy, thirty years. How long will a man lie i' the earth ere he rot? Faith, if he be not rotten before he die,â€”as we have many pocky corses now-a-days, that will scarce hold the laying in,â€”he will last you some eight year or nine year; a tanner will last you nine year. Why he more than another? Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his trade that he will keep out water a great while, and your water is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body. Here's a skull now; this skull hath lain you i' the earth three-and-twenty years. Whose was it? A whoreson mad fellow's it was: whose do you think it was? Nay, I know not. A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! a' poured a flagon of Rhenish on my head once. This same skull, sir, was Yorick's skull, the king's jester. This! E'en that. Let me see.â€” â€”Alas! poor Yorick. I knew him, Horatio; a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy; he hath borne me on his back a thousand times; and now, how abhorred in my imagination it is! my gorge rises at it. Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know not how oft. Where be your gibes now? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment, that were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now, to mock your own grinning? quite chapfallen? Now get you to my lady's chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to this favour she must come; make her laugh at that. Prithee, Horatio, tell me one thing. What's that, my lord? Dost thou think Alexander looked o' this fashion i' the earth? E'en so. And smelt so? pah! E'en so, my lord. To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander, till he find it stopping a bung-hole? 'Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so. No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with modesty enough, and likelihood to lead it; as thus: Alexander died, Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is earth; of earth we make loam, and why of that loam, whereto he was converted, might they not stop a beer-barrel? Imperious CÃ¦sar, dead and turn'd to clay, Might stop a hole to keep the wind away: O! that that earth, which kept the world in awe, Should patch a wall to expal the winter's flaw. But soft! but soft! aside: here comes the king. The queen, the courtiers: who is that they follow? And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken The corse they follow did with desperate hand Fordo its own life; 'twas of some estate. Couch we awhile, and mark. What ceremony else? That is Laertes, A very noble youth: mark. What ceremony else? Her obsequies have been as far enlarg'd As we have warrantise: her death was doubtful, And, but that great command o'ersways the order, She should in ground unsanctified have lodg'd Till the last trumpet; for charitable prayers, Shards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown on her; Yet here she is allow'd her virgin crants, Her maiden strewments, and the bringing home Of bell and burial. Must there no more be done? No more be done: We should profane the service of the dead, To sing a requiem, and such rest to her As to peace-parted souls. Lay her i' the earth; And from her fair and unpolluted flesh May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest, A ministering angel shall my sister be, When thou liest howling. What! the fair Ophelia? Sweets to the sweet: farewell! I hop'd thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife; I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid, And not have strew'd thy grave. O! treble woe Fall ten times treble on that cursed head Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense Depriv'd thee of. Hold off the earth awhile, Till I have caught her once more in mine arms. Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead, Till of this flat a mountain you have made, To o'er-top old Pelion or the skyish head Of blue Olympus. What is he whose grief Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow Conjures the wandering stars, and makes them stand Like wonder-wounded hearers? this is I, Hamlet the Dane. The devil take thy soul! Thou pray'st not well. I prithee, take thy fingers from my throat; For though I am not splenetive and rash Yet have I in me something dangerous, Which let thy wisdom fear. Away thy hand! Pluck them asunder. Hamlet! Hamlet! Gentlemen,â€” Good my lord, be quiet. Why, I will fight with him upon this theme Until my eyelids will no longer wag. O my son! what theme? I lov'd Ophelia: forty thousand brothers Could not, with all their quantity of love, Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her? O! he is mad, Laertes. For love of God, forbear him. 'Swounds, show me what thou'lt do: Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself? Woo't drink up eisel? eat a crocodile? I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine? To outface me with leaping in her grave? Be buried quick with her, and so will I: And, if thou prate of mountains, let them throw Millions of acres on us, till our ground, Singeing his pate against the burning zone, Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth, I'll rant as well as thou. This is mere madness: And thus a while the fit will work on him; Anon, as patient as the female dove, When that her golden couplets are disclos'd, His silence will sit drooping. Hear you, sir; What is the reason that you use me thus? I lov'd you ever: but it is no matter; Let Hercules himself do what he may, The cat will mew and dog will have his day. I pray you, good Horatio, wait upon him. Strengthen your patience in our last night's speech; We'll put the matter to the present push. Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son. This grave shall have a living monument: An hour of quiet shortly shall we see; Till then, in patience our proceeding be. So much for this, sir: now shall you see the other; You do remember all the circumstance? Remember it, my lord? Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting That would not let me sleep; methought I lay Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly,â€” And prais'd be rashness for it, let us know, Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well When our deep plots do pall; and that should teach us There's a divinity that shapes our ends, Rough-hew them how we will. That is most certain. Up from my cabin, My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark Grop'd I to find out them, had my desire, Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew To mine own room again; making so boldâ€” My fears forgetting mannersâ€”to unseal Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio, O royal knavery! an exact command, Larded with many several sorts of reasons Importing Denmark's health, and England's too, With, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life, That, on the supervise, no leisure bated, No, not to stay the grinding of the axe, My head should be struck off. Is 't possible? Here's the commission: read it at more leisure. But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed? I beseech you. Being thus be-netted round with villanies,â€” Ere I could make a prologue to my brains They had begun the play,â€”I sat me down, Devis'd a new commission, wrote it fair; I once did hold it, as our statists do, A baseness to write fair, and labour'd much How to forget that learning; but, sir, now It did me yeoman's service. Wilt thou know The effect of what I wrote? Ay, good my lord. An earnest conjuration from the king, As England was his faithful tributary, As love between them like the palm should flourish, As peace should still her wheaten garland wear, And stand a comma 'tween their amities, And many such-like 'As'es of great charge, That, on the view and knowing of these contents, Without debatement further, more or less, He should the bearers put to sudden death, Not shriving-time allow'd. How was this seal'd? Why, even in that was heaven ordinant. I had my father's signet in my purse, Which was the model of that Danish seal; Folded the writ up in form of the other, Subscrib'd it, gave't th' impression, plac'd it safely, The changeling never known. Now, the next day Was our sea-fight, and what to this was sequent Thou know'st already. So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to 't. Why, man, they did make love to this employment; They are not near my conscience; their defeat Does by their own insinuation grow. 'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes Between the pass and fell-incensed points Of mighty opposites. Why, what a king is this! Does it not, thinks't thee, stand me now uponâ€” He that hath kill'd my king and whor'd my mother, Popp'd in between the election and my hopes, Thrown out his angle for my proper life, And with such cozenageâ€”is 't not perfect conscience To quit him with this arm? and is 't not to be damn'd To let this canker of our nature come In further evil? It must be shortly known to him from England What is the issue of the business there. It will be short: the interim is mine; And a man's life's no more than to say 'One.' But I am very sorry, good Horatio, That to Laertes I forgot myself; For, by the image of my cause, I see The portraiture of his: I'll count his favours: But, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me Into a towering passion. Peace! who comes here? Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark. I humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this water-fly? No, my good lord. Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to know him. He hath much land, and fertile: let a beast be lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at the king's mess: 'tis a chough; but, as I say, spacious in the possession of dirt. Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should impart a thing to you from his majesty. I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of spirit. Your bonnet to his right use; 'tis for the head. I thank your lordship, 'tis very hot. No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is northerly. It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed. But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion. Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry, as 'twere, I cannot tell how. But, my lord, his majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a great wager on your head. Sir, this is the matter,â€” I beseech you, rememberâ€” Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes; believe me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent differences, of very soft society and great showing; indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or calendar of gentry, for you shall find in him the continent of what part a gentleman would see. Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you; though, I know, to divide him inventorially would dizzy the arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of great article; and his infusion of such dearth and rareness, as, to make true diction of him, his semblable is his mirror; and who else would trace him, his umbrage, nothing more. Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him. The concernancy, sir? why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rawer breath? Sir? Is 't not possible to understand in another tongue? You will do 't, sir, really. What imports the nomination of this gentleman? Of Laertes? His purse is empty already; all 's golden words are spent. Of him, sir. I know you are not ignorantâ€” I would you did, sir; in faith, if you did, it would not much approve me. Well, sir. You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes isâ€” I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in excellence; but, to know a man well, were to know himself. I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on him by them, in his meed he's unfellowed. What's his weapon? Rapier and dagger. That's two of his weapons; but, well. The king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary horses; against the which he has imponed, as I take it, six French rapiers and poniards, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers, and so: three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of very liberal conceit. What call you the carriages? I knew you must be edified by the margent, ere you had done. The carriages, sir, are the hangers. The phrase would be more german to the matter, if we could carry cannon by our sides; I would it might be hangers till then. But, on; six Barbary horses against six French swords, their assigns, and three liberal-conceited carriages; that's the French bet against the Danish. Why is this 'imponed,' as you call it? The king, sir, hath laid, that in a dozen passes between yourself and him, he shall not exceed you three hits; he hath laid on twelve for nine, and it would come to immediate trial, if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer. How if I answer no? I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial. Sir, I will walk here in the hall; if it please his majesty, 'tis the breathing time of day with me; let the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the king hold his purpose, I will win for him an I can; if not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits. Shall I re-deliver you so? To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will. I commend my duty to your lordship. Yours, yours. He does well to commend it himself; there are no tongues else for 's turn. This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head. He did comply with his dug before he sucked it. Thus has heâ€”and many more of the same bevy, that I know the drossy age dotes onâ€”only got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter, a kind of yesty collection which carries them through and through the most fond and winnowed opinions; and do but blow them to their trial, the bubbles are out. My lord, his majesty commended him to you by young Osric, who brings back to him, that you attend him in the hall; he sends to know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes, or that you will take longer time. I am constant to my purposes; they follow the king's pleasure: if his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now, or whensoever, provided I be so able as now. The king, and queen, and all are coming down. In happy time. The queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play. She well instructs me. You will lose this wager, my lord. I do not think so; since he went into France, I have been in continual practice; I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst not think how ill all 's here about my heart; but it is no matter. Nay, good my lord,â€” It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gain-giving as would perhaps trouble a woman. If your mind dislike any thing, obey it; I will forestal their repair hither, and say you are not fit. Not a whit, we defy augury; there's a special providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, 'tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will come: the readiness is all. Since no man has aught of what he leaves, what is 't to leave betimes? Let be. Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me. Give me your pardon, sir; I've done you wrong; But pardon 't, as you are a gentleman. This presence knows, And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd With sore distraction. What I have done, That might your nature, honour and exception Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness. Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet: If Hamlet from himself be ta'en away, And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes, Then Hamlet does it not; Hamlet denies it. Who does it then? His madness. If 't be so, Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd; His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy. Sir, in this audience, Let my disclaiming from a purpos'd evil Free me so far in your most generous thoughts, That I have shot mine arrow o'er the house, And hurt my brother. I am satisfied in nature, Whose motive, in this case, should stir me most To my revenge; but in my terms of honour I stand aloof, and will no reconcilement, Till by some elder masters, of known honour, I have a voice and precedent of peace, To keep my name ungor'd. But till that time, I do receive your offer'd love like love, And will not wrong it. I embrace it freely; And will this brother's wager frankly play. Give us the foils. Come on. Come, one for me. I'll be your foil, Laertes; in mine ignorance Your skill shall, like a star i' the darkest night, Stick fiery off indeed. You mock me, sir. No, by this hand. Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet, You know the wager? Very well, my lord; Your Grace hath laid the odds o' the weaker side. I do not fear it; I have seen you both; But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds. This is too heavy; let me see another. This likes me well. These foils have all a length? Ay, my good lord. Set me the stoups of wine upon that table. If Hamlet give the first or second hit, Or quit in answer of the third exchange, Let all the battlements their ordnance fire; The king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath; And in the cup an union shall he throw, Richer than that which four successive kings In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups; And let the kettle to the trumpet speak, The trumpet to the cannoneer without, The cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth, 'Now the king drinks to Hamlet!' Come, begin; And you, the judges, bear a wary eye. Come on, sir. Come, my lord. One. No. Judgment. A hit, a very palpable hit. Well; again. Stay; give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine; Here's to thy health. Give him the cup. I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile. Come.â€” Another hit; what say you? A touch, a touch, I do confess. Our son shall win. He's fat, and scant of breath. Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows; The queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet. Good madam! Gertrude, do not drink. I will, my lord; I pray you, pardon me. It is the poison'd cup! it is too late. I dare not drink yet, madam; by and by. Come, let me wipe thy face. My lord, I'll hit him now. I do not think 't And yet 'tis almost 'gainst my conscience. Come, for the third, Laertes. You but dally; I pray you, pass with your best violence. I am afeard you make a wanton of me. Say you so? come on. Nothing, neither way. Have at you now. Part them! they are incens'd Nay, come, again. Look to the queen there, ho! They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord? How is it, Laertes? Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric; I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery. How does the queen? She swounds to see them bleed. No, no, the drink, the drink,â€”O my dear Hamlet! The drink, the drink; I am poison'd. O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd: Treachery! seek it out. It is here, Hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slain; No medicine in the world can do thee good; In thee there is not half an hour of life; The treacherous instrument is in thy hand, Unbated and envenom'd. The foul practice Hath turn'd itself on me; lo! here I lie, Never to rise again. Thy mother's poison'd. I can no more. The king, the king's to blame. The point envenom'd toolâ€”. Then, venom, to thy work. Treason! treason! O! yet defend me, friends; I am but hurt. Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane, Drink off this potion;â€”is thy union here? Follow my mother. He is justly serv'd; It is a poison temper'd by himself. Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet: Mine and my father's death come not upon thee, Nor thine on me! Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee. I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu! You that look pale and tremble at this chance, That are but mutes or audience to this act, Had I but time,â€”as this fell sergeant, death, Is strict in his arrest,â€”O! I could tell youâ€” But let it be. Horatio, I am dead; Thou liv'st; report me and my cause aright To the unsatisfied. Never believe it; I am more an antique Roman than a Dane: Here's yet some liquor left. As thou'rt a man, Give me the cup: let go; by heaven, I'll have 't. O God! Horatio, what a wounded name, Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me. If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart, Absent thee from felicity awhile, And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain, To tell my story. What war-like noise is this? Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland, To the ambassadors of England gives This war-like volley. O! I die, Horatio; The potent poison quite o'er-crows my spirit: I cannot live to hear the news from England, But I do prophesy the election lights On Fortinbras: he has my dying voice; So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less, Which have solicitedâ€”The rest is silence. Now cracks a noble heart. Good-night, sweet prince, And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest! Why does the drum come hither? Where is this sight? What is it ye would see? If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search. This quarry cries on havoc. O proud death! What feast is toward in thine eternal cell, That thou so many princes at a shot So bloodily hast struck? The sight is dismal; And our affairs from England come too late: The ears are senseless that should give us hearing, To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd, That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead. Where should we have our thanks? Not from his mouth, Had it the ability of life to thank you: He never gave commandment for their death. But since, so jump upon this bloody question, You from the Polack wars, and you from England, Are here arriv'd, give order that these bodies High on a stage be placed to the view; And let me speak to the yet unknowing world How these things came about: so shall you hear Of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts, Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters; Of deaths put on by cunning and forc'd cause, And, in this upshot, purposes mistook Fall'n on the inventors' heads; all this can I Truly deliver. Let us haste to hear it, And call the noblest to the audience. For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune; I have some rights of memory in this kingdom, Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me. Of that I shall have also cause to speak, And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more: But let this same be presently perform'd, Even while men's minds are wild, lest more mischance On plots and errors happen. Let four captains Bear Hamlet, like a soldier, to the stage; For he was likely, had he been put on, To have prov'd most royally: and, for his passage, The soldiers' music and the rites of war Speak loudly for him. Take up the bodies: such a sight as this Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss. Go, bid the soldiers shoot.\n"

      "Tush! Never tell me; I take it much unkindly That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this. 'Sblood, but you will not hear me: If ever I did dream of such a matter, Abhor me. Thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate. Despise me if I do not. Three great ones of the city, In personal suit to make me his lieutenant, Off-capp'd to him; and, by the faith of man. I know my price, I am worth no worse a place; But he, as loving his own pride and purposes, Evades them, with a bombast circumstance Horribly stuff'd with epithets of war; And, in conclusion, Nonsuits my mediators; for, 'Certes,' says he, 'I have already chose my officer.' And what was he? Forsooth, a great arithmetician, One Michael Cassio, a Florentine, A fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife; That never set a squadron in the field, Nor the division of a battle knows More than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric, Wherein the toged consuls can propose As masterly as he: mere prattle, without practice, Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election; And Iâ€”of whom his eyes had seen the proof At Rhodes, at Cyprus, and on other grounds Christian and heathenâ€”must be be-lee'd and calm'd By debitor and creditor; this counter caster, He, in good time, must his lieutenant be, And Iâ€”God bless the mark!â€”his Moorship's ancient. By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman. Why, there's no remedy: 'tis the curse of the service, Preferment goes by letter and affection, Not by the old gradation, where each second Stood heir to the first. Now, sir, be judge yourself, Whe'r I in any just term am affin'd To love the Moor. I would not follow him then. O! sir, content you; I follow him to serve my turn upon him; We cannot all be masters, nor all masters Cannot be truly follow'd. You shall mark Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave, That, doting on his own obsequious bondage, Wears out his time, much like his master's ass, For nought but provender, and when he's old, cashier'd; Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are Who, trimm'd in forms and visages of duty, Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves, And, throwing but shows of service on their lords, Do well thrive by them, and when they have lin'd their coats Do themselves homage: these fellows have some soul; And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir, It is as sure as you are Roderigo, Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago: In following him, I follow but myself; Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty, But seeming so, for my peculiar end: For when my outward action doth demonstrate The native act and figure of my heart In compliment extern, 'tis not long after But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve For daws to peck at: I am not what I am. What a full fortune does the thick-lips owe, If he can carry 't thus! Call up her father; Rouse him, make after him, poison his delight, Proclaim him in the streets, incense her kinsmen, And, though he in a fertile climate dwell, Plague him with flies; though that his joy be joy, Yet throw such changes of vexation on 't As it may lose some colour. Here is her father's house; I'll call aloud. Do; with like timorous accent and dire yell As when, by night and negligence, the fire Is spied in populous cities. What, ho! Brabantio! Signior Brabantio, ho! Awake! what, ho! Brabantio! thieves! thieves! thieves! Look to your house, your daughter, and your bags! Thieves! thieves! What is the reason of this terrible summons? What is the matter there? Signior, is all your family within? Are your doors lock'd? Why? wherefore ask you this? 'Zounds! sir, you're robb'd; for shame, put on your gown; Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul; Even now, now, very now, an old black ram Is tupping your white ewe. Arise, arise! Awake the snorting citizens with the bell, Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you. Arise, I say. What! have you lost your wits? Most reverend signior, do you know my voice? Not I, what are you? My name is Roderigo. The worser welcome: I have charg'd thee not to haunt about my doors: In honest plainness thou hast heard me say My daughter is not for thee; and now, in madness, Being full of supper and distempering draughts, Upon malicious knavery dost thou come To start my quiet. Sir, sir, sir! But thou must needs be sure My spirit and my place have in them power To make this bitter to thee. Patience, good sir. What tell'st thou me of robbing? this is Venice; My house is not a grange. Most grave Brabantio, In simple and pure soul I come to you. 'Zounds! sir, you are one of those that will not serve God if the devil bid you. Because we come to do you service and you think we are ruffians, you'll have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse; you'll have your nephews neigh to you; you'll have coursers for cousins and gennets for germans. What profane wretch art thou? I am one, sir, that comes to tell you, your daughter and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs. Thou art a villain. You areâ€”a senator. This thou shalt answer; I know thee, Roderigo. Sir, I will answer any thing. But, I beseech you, If 't be your pleasure and most wise consent,â€” As partly, I find, it is,â€”that your fair daughter, At this odd-even and dull-watch o' the night, Transported with no worse nor better guard But with a knave of common hire, a gondolier, To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor,â€” If this be known to you, and your allowance, We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs; But if you know not this, my manners tell me We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe, That, from the sense of all civility, I thus would play and trifle with your reverence: Your daughter, if you have not given her leave, I say again, hath made a gross revolt; Tying her duty, beauty, wit and fortunes In an extravagant and wheeling stranger Of here and every where. Straight satisfy yourself: If she be in her chamber or your house, Let loose on me the justice of the state For thus deluding you. Strike on the tinder, ho! Give me a taper! call up all my people! This accident is not unlike my dream; Belief of it oppresses me already. Light, I say! light! Farewell, for I must leave you: It seems not meet nor wholesome to my place To be produc'd, as, if I stay, I shall, Against the Moor; for, I do know the state, However this may gall him with some check, Cannot with safety cast him; for he's embark'd With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,â€” Which even now stand in act,â€”that, for their souls, Another of his fathom they have none, To lead their business; in which regard, Though I do hate him as I do hell-pains, Yet, for necessity of present life, I must show out a flag and sign of love, Which is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find him, Lead to the Sagittary the raised search; And there will I be with him. So, farewell. It is too true an evil: gone she is, And what's to come of my despised time Is nought but bitterness. Now, Roderigo, Where didst thou see her? O, unhappy girl! With the Moor, sayst thou? Who would be a father! How didst thou know 'twas she? O, she deceives me Past thought. What said she to you? Get more tapers! Raise all my kindred! Are they married, think you? Truly, I think they are. O heaven! How got she out? O, treason of the blood: Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters' minds By what you see them act. Are there not charms By which the property of youth and maidhood May be abus'd? Have you not read, Roderigo, Of some such thing? Yes, sir, I have indeed. Call up my brother. O! that you had had her. Some one way, some another! Do you know Where we may apprehend her and the Moor? I think I can discover him, if you please To get good guard and go along with me. Pray you, lead on. At every house I'll call; I may command at most. Get weapons, ho! And raise some special officers of night. On, good Roderigo; I'll deserve your pains. Though in the trade of war I have slain men, Yet do I hold it very stuff o' the conscience To do no contriv'd murder: I lack iniquity Sometimes to do me service. Nine or ten times I had thought to have yerk'd him here under the ribs. 'Tis better as it is. Nay, but he prated, And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms Against your honour That, with the little godliness I have, I did full hard forbear him. But, I pray, sir, Are you fast married? Be assur'd of this, That the magnifico is much belov'd, And hath in his effect a voice potential As double as the duke's; he will divorce you, Or put upon you what restraint and grievance The lawâ€”with all his might to enforce it onâ€” Will give him cable. Let him do his spite: My services which I have done the signiory Shall out-tongue his complaints. 'Tis yet to know, Which when I know that boasting is an honour I shall promulgate, I fetch my life and being From men of royal siege, and my demerits May speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune As this that I have reach'd; for know, Iago, But that I love the gentle Desdemona, I would not my unhoused free condition Put into circumscription and confine For the sea's worth. But, look! what lights come yond? Those are the raised father and his friends: You were best go in. Not I; I must be found: My parts, my title, and my perfect soul Shall manifest me rightly. Is it they? By Janus, I think no. The servants of the duke, and my lieutenant. The goodness of the night upon you, friends! What is the news? The duke does greet you, general, And he requires your haste-post-haste appearance, Even on the instant. What is the matter, think you? Something from Cyprus, as I may divine. It is a business of some heat; the galleys Have sent a dozen sequent messengers This very night at one another's heels, And many of the consuls, rais'd and met, Are at the duke's already. You have been hotly call'd for; When, being not at your lodging to be found, The senate hath sent about three several quests To search you out. 'Tis well I am found by you. I will but spend a word here in the house, And go with you. Ancient, what makes he here? Faith, he to-night hath boarded a land carrack; If it prove lawful prize, he's made for ever. I do not understand. He's married. To who? Marry, toâ€”Come, captain, will you go? Have with you. Here comes another troop to seek for you. It is Brabantio. General, be advis'd; He comes to bad intent. Holla! stand there! Signior, it is the Moor. Down with him, thief! You, Roderigo! come, sir, I am for you. Keep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust them. Good signior, you shall more command with years Than with your weapons. O thou foul thief! where hast thou stow'd my daughter? Damn'd as thou art, thou hast enchanted her; For I'll refer me to all things of sense, If she in chains of magic were not bound, Whether a maid so tender, fair, and happy, So opposite to marriage that she shunn'd The wealthy curled darlings of our nation, Would ever have, to incur a general mock, Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom Of such a thing as thou; to fear, not to delight. Judge me the world, if 'tis not gross in sense That thou hast practis'd on her with foul charms, Abus'd her delicate youth with drugs or minerals That weaken motion: I'll have 't disputed on; 'Tis probable, and palpable to thinking. I therefore apprehend and do attach thee For an abuser of the world, a practiser Of arts inhibited and out of warrant. Lay hold upon him: if he do resist, Subdue him at his peril. Hold your hands, Both you of my inclining, and the rest: Were it my cue to fight, I should have known it Without a prompter. Where will you that I go To answer this your charge? To prison; till fit time Of law and course of direct session Call thee to answer. What if I do obey? How may the duke be therewith satisfied, Whose messengers are here about my side, Upon some present business of the state To bring me to him? 'Tis true, most worthy signior; The duke's in council, and your noble self, I am sure, is sent for. How! the duke in council! In this time of the night! Bring him away. Mine's not an idle cause: the duke himself, Or any of my brothers of the state, Cannot but feel this wrong as 'twere their own; For if such actions may have passage free, Bond-slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be. There is no composition in these news That gives them credit. Indeed, they are disproportion'd; My letters say a hundred and seven galleys. And mine, a hundred and forty. And mine, two hundred: But though they jump not on a just account,â€” As in these cases, where the aim reports, 'Tis oft with difference,â€”yet do they all confirm A Turkish fleet, and bearing up to Cyprus. Nay, it is possible enough to judgment: I do not so secure me in the error, But the main article I do approve In fearful sense. What, ho! what, ho! what, ho! A messenger from the galleys. Now, what's the business? The Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes; So was I bid report here to the state By Signior Angelo. How say you by this change? This cannot be, By no assay of reason; 'tis a pageant To keep us in false gaze. When we consider The importancy of Cyprus to the Turk, And let ourselves again but understand, That as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes, So may he with more facile question bear it, For that it stands not in such war-like brace, But altogether lacks the abilities That Rhodes is dress'd in: if we make thought of this, We must not think the Turk is so unskilful To leave that latest which concerns him first, Neglecting an attempt of ease and gain, To wake and wage a danger profitless. Nay, in all confidence, he's not for Rhodes. Here is more news. The Ottomites, reverend and gracious, Steering with due course toward the isle of Rhodes, Have there injointed them with an after fleet. Ay, so I thought. How many, as you guess? Of thirty sail; and now they do re-stem Their backward course, bearing with frank appearance Their purposes toward Cyprus. Signior Montano, Your trusty and most valiant servitor, With his free duty recommends you thus, And prays you to believe him. 'Tis certain then, for Cyprus. Marcus Luccicos, is not he in town? He's now in Florence. Write from us to him; post-post-haste dispatch. Here comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor. Valiant Othello, we must straight employ you Against the general enemy Ottoman. I did not see you; welcome, gentle signior; We lack'd your counsel and your help to-night. So did I yours. Good your grace, pardon me; Neither my place nor aught I heard of business Hath rais'd me from my bed, nor doth the general care Take hold of me, for my particular grief Is of so flood-gate and o'erbearing nature That it engluts and swallows other sorrows And it is still itself. Why, what's the matter? My daughter! O! my daughter. Dead? Dead? Ay, to me; She is abus'd, stol'n from me, and corrupted By spells and medicines bought of mounte-banks; For nature so preposterously to err, Being not deficient, blind, or lame of sense, Sans witchcraft could not. Whoe'er he be that in this foul proceeding Hath thus beguil'd your daughter of herself And you of her, the bloody book of law You shall yourself read in the bitter letter After your own sense; yea, though our proper son Stood in your action. Humbly I thank your Grace. Here is the man, this Moor; whom now, it seems, Your special mandate for the state affairs, Hath hither brought. We are very sorry for it. We are very sorry for it. What, in your own part, can you say to this? Nothing, but this is so. Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors, My very noble and approv'd good masters, That I have ta'en away this old man's daughter, It is most true; true, I have married her: The very head and front of my offending Hath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech, And little bless'd with the soft phrase of peace; For since these arms of mine had seven years' pith, Till now some nine moons wasted, they have us'd Their dearest action in the tented field; And little of this great world can I speak, More than pertains to feats of broil and battle; And therefore little shall I grace my cause In speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious patience, I will a round unvarnish'd tale deliver Of my whole course of love; what drugs, what charms, What conjuration, and what mighty magic, For such proceeding I am charg'd withal, I won his daughter. A maiden never bold; Of spirit so still and quiet, that her motion Blush'd at herself; and she, in spite of nature, Of years, of country, credit, every thing, To fall in love with what she fear'd to look on! It is a judgment maim'd and most imperfect That will confess perfection so could err Against all rules of nature, and must be driven To find out practices of cunning hell, Why this should be. I therefore vouch again That with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood, Or with some dram conjur'd to this effect, He wrought upon her. To vouch this, is no proof, Without more certain and more overt test Than these thin habits and poor likelihoods Of modern seeming do prefer against him. But, Othello, speak: Did you by indirect and forced courses Subdue and poison this young maid's affections; Or came it by request and such fair question As soul to soul affordeth? I do beseech you, Send for the lady to the Sagittary, And let her speak of me before her father: If you do find me foul in her report, The trust, the office I do hold of you, Not only take away, but let your sentence Even fall upon my life. Fetch Desdemona hither. Ancient, conduct them; you best know the place. And, till she come, as truly as to heaven I do confess the vices of my blood, So justly to your grave ears I'll present How I did thrive in this fair lady's love, And she in mine. Say it, Othello. Her father lov'd me; oft invited me; Still question'd me the story of my life From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes That I have pass'd. I ran it through, even from my boyish days To the very moment that he bade me tell it; Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances, Of moving accidents by flood and field, Of hair-breadth 'scapes i' the imminent deadly breach, Of being taken by the insolent foe And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence And portance in my travel's history; Wherein of antres vast and desarts idle, Rough quarries, rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven, It was my hint to speak, such was the process; And of the Cannibals that each other eat, The Anthropophagi, and men whose heads Do grow beneath their shoulders. This to hear Would Desdemona seriously incline; But still the house-affairs would draw her thence; Which ever as she could with haste dispatch, She'd come again, and with a greedy ear Devour up my discourse. Which I observing, Took once a pliant hour, and found good means To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart That I would all my pilgrimage dilate, Whereof by parcels she had something heard, But not intentively: I did consent; And often did beguile her of her tears, When I did speak of some distressful stroke That my youth suffer'd. My story being done, She gave me for my pains a world of sighs: She swore, in faith, 'twas strange, 'twas passing strange; 'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful: She wish'd she had not heard it, yet she wish'd That heaven had made her such a man; she thank'd me, And bade me, if I had a friend that lov'd her, I should but teach him how to tell my story, And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake: She lov'd me for the dangers I had pass'd, And I lov'd her that she did pity them. This only is the witchcraft I have us'd: Here comes the lady; let her witness it. I think this tale would win my daughter too. Good Brabantio, Take up this mangled matter at the best; Men do their broken weapons rather use Than their bare hands. I pray you, hear her speak: If she confess that she was half the wooer, Destruction on my head, if my bad blame Light on the man! Come hither, gentle mistress: Do you perceive in all this noble company Where most you owe obedience? My noble father, I do perceive here a divided duty: To you I am bound for life and education; My life and education both do learn me How to respect you; you are the lord of duty, I am hitherto your daughter: but here's my husband; And so much duty as my mother show'd To you, preferring you before her father, So much I challenge that I may profess Due to the Moor my lord. God be with you! I have done. Please it your Grace, on to the state affairs: I had rather to adopt a child than get it. Come hither, Moor: I here do give thee that with all my heart Which, but thou hast already, with all my heart I would keep from thee. For your sake, jewel, I am glad at soul I have no other child; For thy escape would teach me tyranny, To hang clogs on them. I have done, my lord. Let me speak like yourself and lay a sentence, Which as a grize or step, may help these lovers Into your favour. When remedies are past, the griefs are ended By seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended. To mourn a mischief that is past and gone Is the next way to draw new mischief on. What cannot be preserv'd when Fortune takes, Patience her injury a mockery makes. The robb'd that smiles steals something from the thief; He robs himself that spends a bootless grief. So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile; We lose it not so long as we can smile. He bears the sentence well that nothing bears But the free comfort which from thence he hears; But he bears both the sentence and the sorrow That, to pay grief, must of poor patience borrow. These sentences, to sugar, or to gall, Being strong on both sides, are equivocal: But words are words; I never yet did hear That the bruis'd heart was pierced through the ear. I humbly beseech you, proceed to the affairs of state. The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for Cyprus. Othello, the fortitude of the place is best known to you; and though we have there a substitute of most allowed sufficiency, yet opinion, a sovereign mistress of effects, throws a more safer voice on you: you must therefore be content to slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this more stubborn and boisterous expedition. The tyrant custom, most grave senators, Hath made the flinty and steel couch of war My thrice-driven bed of down: I do agnize A natural and prompt alacrity I find in hardness, and do undertake These present wars against the Ottomites. Most humbly therefore bending to your state, I crave fit disposition for my wife, Due reference of place and exhibition, With such accommodation and besort As levels with her breeding. If you please, Be 't at her father's. I'll not have it so. Nor I. Nor I; I would not there reside, To put my father in impatient thoughts By being in his eye. Most gracious duke, To my unfolding lend your gracious ear; And let me find a charter in your voice To assist my simpleness. What would you, Desdemona? That I did love the Moor to live with him, My downright violence and storm of fortunes May trumpet to the world; my heart's subdu'd Even to the very quality of my lord; I saw Othello's visage in his mind, And to his honours and his valiant parts Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate. So that, dear lords, if I be left behind, A moth of peace, and he go to the war, The rites for which I love him are bereft me, And I a heavy interim shall support By his dear absence. Let me go with him. Let her have your voices. Vouch with me, heaven, I therefore beg it not To please the palate of my appetite, Nor to comply with heat,â€”the young affects In me defunct,â€”and proper satisfaction, But to be free and bounteous to her mind; And heaven defend your good souls that you think I will your serious and great business scant For she is with me. No, when light-wing'd toys Of feather'd Cupid seel with wanton dulness My speculative and offic'd instruments, That my disports corrupt and taint my business, Let housewives make a skillet of my helm, And all indign and base adversities Make head against my estimation! Be it as you shall privately determine, Either for her stay or going. The affair cries haste, And speed must answer it. You must away to-night. With all my heart. At nine i' the morning here we'll meet again. Othello, leave some officer behind, And he shall our commission bring to you; With such things else of quality and respect As doth import you. So please your Grace, my ancient; A man he is of honesty and trust: To his conveyance I assign my wife, With what else needful your good grace shall think To be sent after me. Let it be so. Good night to every one. And, noble signior, If virtue no delighted beauty lack, Your son-in-law is far more fair than black. Adieu, brave Moor! use Desdemona well. Look to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see: She has deceiv'd her father, and may thee. My life upon her faith! Honest Iago, My Desdemona must I leave to thee: I prithee, let thy wife attend on her; And bring them after in the best advantage. Come, Desdemona; I have but an hour Of love, of worldly matters and direction, To spend with thee: we must obey the time. Iago! What sayst thou, noble heart? What will I do, think'st thou? Why, go to bed, and sleep. I will incontinently drown myself. Well, if thou dost, I shall never love thee after. Why, thou silly gentleman! It is silliness to live when to live is torment; and then have we a prescription to die when death is our physician. O! villanous; I have looked upon the world for four times seven years, and since I could distinguish betwixt a benefit and an injury, I never found man that knew how to love himself. Ere I would say, I would drown myself for the love of a guinea-hen, I would change my humanity with a baboon. What should I do? I confess it is my shame to be so fond; but it is not in my virtue to amend it. Virtue! a fig! 'tis in ourselves that we are thus, or thus. Our bodies are our gardens, to the which our wills are gardeners; so that if we will plant nettles or sow lettuce, set hyssop and woed up thyme, supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it with many, either to have it sterile with idleness or manured with industry, why, the power and corrigible authority of this lies in our wills. If the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality, the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most preposterous conclusions; but we have reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal stings, our unbitted lusts, whereof I take this that you call love to be a sect or scion. It cannot be. It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will. Come, be a man. Drown thyself! drown cats and blind puppies. I have professed me thy friend, and I confess me knit to thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness; I could never better stead thee than now. Put money in thy purse; follow these wars; defeat thy favour with a usurped beard; I say, put money in thy purse. It cannot be that Desdemona should long continue her love to the Moor,â€”put money in thy purse,â€”nor he his to her. It was a violent commencement in her, and thou shalt see an answerable sequestration; put but money in thy purse. These Moors are changeable in their wills;â€”fill thy purse with money:â€”the food that to him now is as luscious as locusts, shall be to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida. She must change for youth: when she is sated with his body, she will find the error of her choice. She must have change, she must: therefore put money in thy purse. If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a more delicate way than drowning. Make all the money thou canst. If sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian and a supersubtle Venetian be not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell, thou shalt enjoy her; therefore make money. A pox of drowning thyself! it is clean out of the way: seek thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than to be drowned and go without her. Wilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend on the issue? Thou art sure of me: go, make money. I have told thee often, and I re-tell thee again and again, I hate the Moor: my cause is hearted: thine hath no less reason. Let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him; if thou canst cuckold him, thou dost thyself a pleasure, me a sport. There are many events in the womb of time which will be delivered. Traverse; go: provide thy money. We will have more of this to-morrow. Adieu. Where shall we meet i' the morning? At my lodging. I'll be with thee betimes. Go to; farewell. Do you hear, Roderigo? What say you? No more of drowning, do you hear? I am changed. I'll sell all my land. Go to; farewell! put money enough in your purse. Thus do I ever make my fool my purse; For I mine own gain'd knowledge should profane, If I would time expend with such a snipe But for my sport and profit. I hate the Moor, And it is thought abroad that 'twixt my sheets He has done my office: I know not if 't be true, But I, for mere suspicion in that kind, Will do as if for surety. He holds me well; The better shall my purpose work on him. Cassio's a proper man; let me see now: To get his place; and to plume up my will In double knavery; how, how? Let's see: After some time to abuse Othello's ear That he is too familiar with his wife: He hath a person and a smooth dispose To be suspected; framed to make women false. The Moor is of a free and open nature, That thinks men honest that but seem to be so, And will as tenderly be led by the nose As asses are. I have 't; it is engender'd: hell and night Must bring this monstrous birth to the world's light. What from the cape can you discern at sea? Nothing at all: it is a high-wrought flood; I cannot 'twixt the heaven and the main Descry a sail. Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land; A fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements; If it hath ruffian'd so upon the sea, What ribs of oak, when mountains melt on them, Can hold the mortise? what shall we hear of this? A segregation of the Turkish fleet; For do but stand upon the foaming shore, The chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds; The wind-shak'd surge, with high and monstrous mane, Seems to cast water on the burning bear And quench the guards of the ever-fixed pole: I never did like molestation view On the enchafed flood. If that the Turkish fleet Be not enshelter'd and embay'd, they are drown'd; It is impossible they bear it out. News, lads! our wars are done. The desperate tempest hath so bang'd the Turks That their designment halts; a noble ship of Venice Hath seen a grievous wrack and sufferance On most part of their fleet. How! is this true? The ship is here put in, A Veronesa; Michael Cassio, Lieutenant to the war-like Moor Othello, Is come on shore: the Moor himself's at sea, And is in full commission here for Cyprus. I am glad on 't; 'tis a worthy governor. But this same Cassio, though he speak of comfort Touching the Turkish loss, yet he looks sadly And prays the Moor be safe; for they were parted With foul and violent tempest. Pray heaven he be; For I have serv'd him, and the man commands Like a full soldier. Let's to the sea-side, ho! As well to see the vessel that's come in As to throw out our eyes for brave Othello, Even till we make the main and the aerial blue An indistinct regard. Come, let's do so; For every minute is expectancy Of more arrivance. Thanks, you the valiant of this war-like isle, That so approve the Moor. O! let the heavens Give him defence against the elements, For I have lost him on a dangerous sea. Is he well shipp'd? His bark is stoutly timber'd, and his pilot Of very expert and approv'd allowance; Therefore my hopes, not surfeited to death, Stand in bold cure. What noise? The town is empty; on the brow o' the sea Stand ranks of people, and they cry, 'A sail!' My hopes do shape him for the governor. They do discharge their shot of courtesy; Our friends at least. I pray you, sir, go forth, And give us truth who 'tis that is arriv'd. I shall. But, good lieutenant, is your general wiv'd? Most fortunately: he hath achiev'd a maid That paragons description and wild fame; One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens, And in th' essential vesture of creation Does tire the ingener. How now! who has put in? 'Tis one Iago, ancient to the general. He has had most favourable and happy speed: Tempests themselves, high seas, and howling winds, The gutter'd rocks, and congregated sands, Traitors ensteep'd to clog the guiltless keel, As having sense of beauty, do omit Their mortal natures, letting go safely by The divine Desdemona. What is she? She that I spake of, our great captain's captain, Left in the conduct of the bold Iago, Whose footing here anticipates our thoughts A se'nnight's speed. Great Jove, Othello guard, And swell his sail with thine own powerful breath, That he may bless this bay with his tall ship, Make love's quick pants in Desdemona's arms, Give renew'd fire to our extinc'ed spirits, And bring all Cyprus comfort! O! behold, The riches of the ship is come on shore. Ye men of Cyprus, let her have your knees. Hail to thee, lady! and the grace of heaven, Before, behind thee, and on every hand, Enwheel thee round! I thank you, valiant Cassio. What tidings can you tell me of my lord? He is not yet arriv'd; nor know I aught But that he's well, and will be shortly here. O! but I fearâ€”How lost you company? The great contention of the sea and skies Parted our fellowship. But hark! a sail. They give their greeting to the citadel: This likewise is a friend. See for the news! Good ancient, you are welcome:â€” welcome, mistress. Let it not gall your patience, good Iago, That I extend my manners; 'tis my breeding That gives me this bold show of courtesy. Sir, would she give you so much of her lips As of her tongue she oft bestows on me, You'd have enough. Alas! she has no speech. In faith, too much; I find it still when I have list to sleep: Marry, before your ladyship, I grant, She puts her tongue a little in her heart, And chides with thinking. You have little cause to say so. Come on, come on; you are pictures out of doors, Bells in your parlours, wild cats in your kitchens, Saints in your injuries, devils being offended, Players in your housewifery, and housewives in your beds. O! fie upon thee, slanderer. Nay, it is true, or else I am a Turk: You rise to play and go to bed to work. You shall not write my praise. No, let me not. What wouldst thou write of me, if thou shouldst praise me? O gentle lady, do not put me to 't, For I am nothing if not critical. Come on; assay. There's one gone to the harbour? Ay, madam. I am not merry, but I do beguile The thing I am by seeming otherwise. Come, how wouldst thou praise me? I am about it; but indeed my invention Comes from my pate as birdlime does from frize; It plucks out brains and all: but my muse labours, And thus she is deliver'd. If she be fair and wise, fairness and wit, The one's for use, the other useth it. Well prais'd! How if she be black and witty? If she be black, and thereto have a wit, She'll find a white that shall her blackness fit. Worse and worse. How if fair and foolish? She never yet was foolish that was fair, For even her folly help'd her to an heir. These are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i' the alehouse. What miserable praise hast thou for her that's foul and foolish? There's none so foul and foolish thereunto But does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do. O heavy ignorance! thou praisest the worst best. But what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving woman indeed, one that, in the authority of her merit, did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself? She that was ever fair and never proud, Had tongue at will and yet was never loud, Never lack'd gold and yet went never gay, Fled from her wish and yet said 'Now I may,' She that being anger'd, her revenge being nigh, Bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly, She that in wisdom never was so frail To change the cod's head for the salmon's tail, She that could think and ne'er disclose her mind, See suitors following and not look behind, She was a wight, if ever such wight were,â€” To do what? To suckle fools and chronicle small beer. O most lame and impotent conclusion! Do not learn of him, Emilia, though he be thy husband. How say you, Cassio? is he not a most profane and liberal counsellor? He speaks home, madam; you may relish him more in the soldier than in the scholar. He takes her by the palm; ay, well said, whisper; with as little a web as this will I ensnare as great a fly as Cassio. Ay, smile upon her, do; I will gyve thee in thine own courtship. You say true, 'tis so, indeed. If such tricks as these strip you out of your lieutenantry, it had been better you had not kissed your three fingers so oft, which now again you are most apt to play the sir in. Very good; well kissed! an excellent courtesy! 'tis so, indeed. Yet again your fingers to your lips? would they were clyster-pipes for your sake! The Moor! I know his trumpet. 'Tis truly so. Let's meet him and receive him. Lo! where he comes. O my fair warrior! My dear Othello! It gives me wonder great as my content To see you here before me. O my soul's joy! If after every tempest come such calms, May the winds blow till they have waken'd death! And let the labouring bark climb hills of seas Olympus-high, and duck again as low As hell's from heaven! If it were now to die, 'Twere now to be most happy, for I fear My soul hath her content so absolute That not another comfort like to this Succeeds in unknown fate. The heavens forbid But that our loves and comforts should increase Even as our days do grow! Amen to that, sweet powers! I cannot speak enough of this content; It stops me here; it is too much of joy: And this, and this, the greatest discords be, That e'er our hearts shall make! O! you are well tun'd now, But I'll set down the pegs that make this music, As honest as I am. Come, let us to the castle. News, friends; our wars are done, the Turks are drown'd. How does my old acquaintance of this isle? Honey, you shall be well desir'd in Cyprus; I have found great love amongst them. O my sweet, I prattle out of fashion, and I dote In mine own comforts. I prithee, good Iago, Go to the bay and disembark my coffers. Bring thou the master to the citadel; He is a good one, and his worthiness Does challenge much respect. Come, Desdemona, Once more well met at Cyprus. Do thou meet me presently at the harbour. Come hither. If thou be'st valiant, as they say base men being in love have then a nobility in their natures more than is native to them, list me. The lieutenant to-night watches on the court of guard: first, I must tell thee this, Desdemona is directly in love with him. With him! why, 'tis not possible. Lay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed. Mark me with what violence she first loved the Moor but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies; and will she love him still for prating? let not thy discreet heart think it. Her eye must be fed; and what delight shall she have to look on the devil? When the blood is made dull with the act of sport, there should be, again to inflame it, and to give satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favour, sympathy in years, manners, and beauties; all which the Moor is defective in. Now, for want of these required conveniences, her delicate tenderness will find itself abused, begin to heave the gorge, disrelish and abhor the Moor; very nature will instruct her in it, and compel her to some second choice. Now, sir, this granted, as it is a most pregnant and unforced position, who stands so eminently in the degree of this fortune as Cassio does? a knave very voluble, no further conscionable than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane seeming, for the better compassing of his salt and most hidden loose affection? why, none; why, none: a slipper and subtle knave, a finder-out of occasions, that has an eye can stamp and counterfeit advantages, though true advantage never present itself; a devilish knave! Besides, the knave is handsome, young, and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds look after; a pestilent complete knave! and the woman hath found him already. I cannot believe that in her; she is full of most blessed condition. Blessed fig's end! the wine she drinks is made of grapes; if she had been blessed she would never have loved the Moor; blessed pudding! Didst thou not see her paddle with the palm of his hand? didst not mark that? Yes, that I did; but that was but courtesy. Lechery, by this hand! an index and obscure prologue to the history of lust and foul thoughts. They met so near with their lips, that their breaths embraced together. Villanous thoughts, Roderigo! when these mutualities so marshal the way, hard at hand comes the master and main exercise, the incorporate conclusion. Pish! But, sir, be you ruled by me: I have brought you from Venice. Watch you to-night; for the command, I'll lay 't upon you: Cassio knows you not. I'll not be far from you: do you find some occasion to anger Cassio, either by speaking too loud, or tainting his discipline; or from what other course you please, which the time shall more favourably minister. Well. Sir, he is rash and very sudden in choler, and haply may strike at you: provoke him, that he may; for even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to mutiny, whose qualification shall come into no true taste again but by the displanting of Cassio. So shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by the means I shall then have to prefer them; and the impediment most profitably removed, without the which there were no expectation of our prosperity. I will do this, if I can bring it to any opportunity. I warrant thee. Meet me by and by at the citadel: I must fetch his necessaries ashore. Farewell. Adieu. That Cassio loves her, I do well believe it; That she loves him, 'tis apt, and of great credit: The Moor, howbeit that I endure him not, Is of a constant, loving, noble nature; And I dare think he'll prove to Desdemona A most dear husband. Now, I do love her too; Not out of absolute lust,â€”though peradventure I stand accountant for as great a sin,â€” But partly led to diet my revenge, For that I do suspect the lusty Moor Hath leap'd into my seat; the thought whereof Doth like a poisonous mineral gnaw my inwards; And nothing can or shall content my soul Till I am even'd with him, wife for wife; Or failing so, yet that I put the Moor At least into a jealousy so strong That judgment cannot cure. Which thing to do, If this poor trash of Venice, whom I trash For his quick hunting, stand the putting on, I'll have our Michael Cassio on the hip; Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb, For I fear Cassio with my night-cap too, Make the Moor thank me, love me, and reward me For making him egregiously an ass And practising upon his peace and quiet Even to madness. 'Tis here, but yet confus'd: Knavery's plain face is never seen till us'd. It is Othello's pleasure, our noble and valiant general, that, upon certain tidings now arrived, importing the mere perdition of the Turkish fleet, every man put himself into triumph; some to dance, some to make bonfires, each man to what sport and revels his addiction leads him; for, besides these beneficial news, it is the celebration of his nuptial. So much was his pleasure should be proclaimed. All offices are open, and there is full liberty of feasting from this present hour of five till the bell have told eleven. Heaven bless the isle of Cyprus and our noble general Othello! Good Michael, look you to the guard to-night: Let's teach ourselves that honourable stop, Not to outsport discretion. Iago hath direction what to do; But, notwithstanding, with my personal eye Will I look to 't. Iago is most honest. Michael, good night; to-morrow with your earliest Let me have speech with you. Come, my dear love, The purchase made, the fruits are to ensue; That profit's yet to come 'twixt me and you. Good night. Welcome, Iago; we must to the watch. Not this hour, lieutenant; 'tis not yet ten o' the clock. Our general cast us thus early for the love of his Desdemona, who let us not therefore blame; he hath not yet made wanton the night with her, and she is sport for Jove. She's a most exquisite lady. And, I'll warrant her, full of game. Indeed, she is a most fresh and delicate creature. What an eye she has! methinks it sounds a parley of provocation. An inviting eye; and yet methinks right modest. And when she speaks, is it not an alarum to love? She is indeed perfection. Well, happiness to their sheets! Come, lieutenant, I have a stoup of wine, and here without are a brace of Cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to the health of black Othello. Not to-night, good Iago: I have very poor and unhappy brains for drinking: I could well wish courtesy would invent some other custom of entertainment. O! they are our friends; but one cup: I'll drink for you. I have drunk but one cup to-night, and that was craftily qualified too, and, behold, what innovation it makes here: I am unfortunate in the infirmity, and dare not task my weakness with any more. What, man! 'tis a night of revels; the gallants desire it. Where are they? Here at the door; I pray you, call them in. I'll do 't; but it dislikes me. If I can fasten but one cup upon him, With that which he hath drunk to-night already, He'll be as full of quarrel and offence As my young mistress' dog. Now, my sick fool Roderigo, Whom love has turn'd almost the wrong side out, To Desdemona hath to-night carous'd Potations pottle deep; and he's to watch. Three lads of Cyprus, noble swelling spirits, That hold their honours in a wary distance, The very elements of this war-like isle, Have I to-night fluster'd with flowing cups, And they watch too. Now, 'mongst this flock of drunkards, Am I to put our Cassio in some action That may offend the isle. But here they come. If consequence do but approve my dream, My boat sails freely, both with wind and stream. 'Fore God, they have given me a rouse already. Good faith, a little one; not past a pint, as I am a soldier. Some wine, ho! And let me the canakin clink, clink; And let me the canakin clink: A soldier's a man; A life's but a span; Why then let a soldier drink. Some wine, boys! 'Fore God, an excellent song. I learned it in England, where indeed they are most potent in potting; your Dane, your German, and your swag-bellied Hollander, â€”drink, ho!â€”are nothing to your English. Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking? Why, he drinks you with facility your Dane dead drunk; he sweats not to overthrow your Almain; he gives your Hollander a vomit ere the next pottle can be filled. To the health of our general! I am for it, lieutenant; and I'll do you justice. O sweet England! King Stephen was a worthy peer, His breeches cost him but a crown; He held them sixpence all too dear, With that he call'd the tailor lown. He was a wight of high renown, And thou art but of low degree: 'Tis pride that pulls the country down, Then take thine auld cloak about thee. Some wine, ho! Why, this is a more exquisite song than the other. Will you hear 't again? No; for I hold him to be unworthy of his place that does those things. Well, God's above all; and there be souls must be saved, and there be souls must not be saved. It's true, good lieutenant. For mine own part,â€”no offence to the general, nor any man of quality,â€”I hope to be saved. And so do I too, lieutenant. Ay; but, by your leave, not before me; the lieutenant is to be saved before the ancient. Let's have no more of this; let's to our affairs. God forgive us our sins! Gentlemen, let's look to our business. Do not think, gentlemen, I am drunk: this is my ancient; this is my right hand, and this is my left hand. I am not drunk now; I can stand well enough, and speak well enough. Excellent well. Why, very well, then; you must not think then that I am drunk. To the platform, masters; come, let's set the watch. You see this fellow that is gone before; He is a soldier fit to stand by CÃ¦sar And give direction; and do but see his vice; 'Tis to his virtue a just equinox, The one as long as the other; 'tis pity of him. I fear the trust Othello puts him in, On some odd time of his infirmity, Will shake this island. But is he often thus? 'Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep: He'll watch the horologe a double set, If drink rock not his cradle. It were well The general were put in mind of it. Perhaps he sees it not; or his good nature Prizes the virtue that appears in Cassio, And looks not on his evils. Is not this true? How now, Roderigo! I pray you, after the lieutenant; go. And 'tis great pity that the noble Moor Should hazard such a place as his own second With one of an ingraft infirmity; It were an honest action to say So to the Moor. Not I, for this fair island: I do love Cassio well, and would do much To cure him of this evil. But hark! what noise? You rogue! you rascal! What's the matter, lieutenant? A knave teach me my duty! I'll beat the knave into a twiggen bottle. Beat me! Dost thou prate, rogue? Nay, good lieutenant; I pray you, sir, hold your hand. Let me go, sir, Or I'll knock you o'er the mazzard. Come, come; you're drunk. Drunk! Away, I say! go out, and cry a mutiny. Nay, good lieutenant! God's will, gentlemen! Help, ho! Lieutenant! sir! Montano! sir! Help, masters! Here's a goodly watch indeed! Who's that that rings the bell? Diablo, ho! The town will rise: God's will! lieutenant, hold! You will be sham'd for ever. What is the matter here? 'Zounds! I bleed still; I am hurt to the death. Hold, for your lives! Hold, ho, lieutenant! Sir! Montano! gentlemen! Have you forgot all sense of place and duty? Hold! the general speaks to you; hold for shame! Why, how now, ho! from whence ariseth this? Are we turn'd Turks, and to ourselves do that Which heaven hath forbid the Ottomites? For Christian shame put by this barbarous brawl; He that stirs next to carve for his own rage Holds his soul light; he dies upon his motion. Silence that dreadful bell! it frights the isle From her propriety. What is the matter, masters? Honest Iago, that look'st dead with grieving, Speak, who began this? on thy love, I charge thee. I do not know; friends all but now, even now, In quarter and in terms like bride and groom Devesting them for bed; and then, but now,â€” As if some planet had unwitted men,â€” Swords out, and tilting one at other's breast, In opposition bloody. I cannot speak Any beginning to this peevish odds, And would in action glorious I had lost Those legs that brought me to a part of it! How comes it, Michael, you are thus forgot? I pray you, pardon me; I cannot speak. Worthy Montano, you were wont be civil; The gravity and stillness of your youth The world hath noted, and your name is great In mouths of wisest censure: what's the matter, That you unlace your reputation thus And spend your rich opinion for the name Of a night-brawler? give me answer to it. Worthy Othello, I am hurt to danger; Your officer, Iago, can inform you, While I spare speech, which something now offends me, Of all that I do know; nor know I aught By me that's said or done amiss this night, Unless self-charity be sometimes a vice, And to defend ourselves it be a sin When violence assails us. Now, by heaven, My blood begins my safer guides to rule, And passion, having my best judgment collied, Assays to lead the way. If I once stir, Or do but lift this arm, the best of you Shall sink in my rebuke. Give me to know How this foul rout began, who set it on; And he that is approv'd in this offence, Though he had twinn'd with meâ€”both at a birthâ€” Shall lose me. What! in a town of war, Yet wild, the people's hearts brimful of fear, To manage private and domestic quarrel, In night, and on the court and guard of safety! 'Tis monstrous. Iago, who began 't? If partially affin'd, or leagu'd in office, Thou dost deliver more or less than truth, Thou art no soldier. Touch me not so near; I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth Than it should do offence to Michael Cassio; Yet, I persuade myself, to speak the truth Shall nothing wrong him. Thus it is, general. Montano and myself being in speech, There comes a fellow crying out for he'p, And Cassio following with determin'd sword To execute upon him. Sir, this gentleman Steps in to Cassio, and entreats his pause; Myself the crying fellow did pursue, Lest by his clamour, as it so fell out, The town might fall in fright; he, swift of foot, Outran my purpose, and I return'd the rather For that I heard the clink and fall of swords, And Cassio high in oath, which till to-night I ne'er might say before. When I came back,â€” For this was brief,â€”I found them close together, At blow and thrust, even as again they were When you yourself did part them. More of this matter can I not report: But men are men; the best sometimes forget: Though Cassio did some little wrong to him, As men in rage strike those that wish them best, Yet, surely Cassio, I believe, receiv'd From him that fled some strange indignity, Which patience could not pass. I know, Iago, Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter, Making it light to Cassio. Cassio, I love thee; But never more be officer of mine. Look! if my gentle love be not rais'd up; I'll make thee an example. What's the matter? All's well now, sweeting; come away to bed. Sir, for your hurts, myself will be your surgeon. Lead him off. Iago, look with care about the town, And silence those whom this vile brawl distracted. Come, Desdemona; 'tis the soldiers' life, To have their balmy slumbers wak'd with strife. What! are you hurt, lieutenant? Ay; past all surgery. Marry, heaven forbid! Reputation, reputation, reputation! O! I have lost my reputation. I have lost the immortal part of myself, and what remains is bestial. My reputation, Iago, my reputation! As I am an honest man, I thought you had received some bodily wound; there is more offence in that than in reputation. Reputation is an idle and most false imposition; oft got without merit, and lost without deserving: you have lost no reputation at all, unless you repute yourself such a loser. What! man; there are ways to recover the general again; you are but now cast in his mood, a punishment more in policy than in malice; even so as one would beat his offenceless dog to affright an imperious lion. Sue to him again, and he is yours. I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a commander with so slight, so drunken, and so indiscreet an officer. Drunk! and speak parrot! and squabble, swagger, swear, and discourse fustian with one's own shadow! O thou invisible spirit of wine! if thou hast no name to be known by, let us call thee devil! What was he that you followed with your sword? What had he done to you? I know not. Is 't possible? I remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly; a quarrel, but nothing wherefore. O God! that men should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains; that we should, with joy, pleasance, revel, and applause, transform ourselves into beasts. Why, but you are now well enough; how came you thus recovered? It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place to the devil wrath; one unperfectness shows me another, to make me frankly despise myself. Come, you are too severe a moraler. As the time, the place, and the condition of this country stands, I could heartily wish this had not befallen, but since it is as it is, mend it for your own good. I will ask him for my place again; he shall tell me I am a drunkard! Had I as many mouths as Hydra, such an answer would stop them all. To be now a sensible man, by and by a fool, and presently a beast! O strange! Every inordinate cup is unblessed and the ingredient is a devil. Come, come; good wine is a good familiar creature if it be well used; exclaim no more against it. And, good lieutenant, I think you think I love you. I have well approved it, sir. I drunk! You or any man living may be drunk at some time, man. I'll tell you what you shall do. Our general's wife is now the general: I may say so in this respect, for that he hath devoted and given up himself to the contemplation, mark, and denotement of her parts and graces: confess yourself freely to her; importune her; she'll help to put you in your place again. She is of so free, so kind, so apt, so blessed a disposition, that she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested. This broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to splinter; and my fortunes against any lay worth naming, this crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before. You advise me well. I protest, in the sincerity of love and honest kindness. I think it freely; and betimes in the morning I will beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me. I am desperate of my fortunes if they check me here. You are in the right. Good night, lieutenant; I must to the watch. Good night, honest Iago! And what's he then that says I play the villain? When this advice is free I give and honest, Probal to thinking and indeed the course To win the Moor again? For 'tis most easy The inclining Desdemona to subdue In any honest suit; she's fram'd as fruitful As the free elements. And then for her To win the Moor, were 't to renounce his baptism, All seals and symbols of redeemed sin, His soul is so enfetter'd to her love, That she may make, unmake, do what she list, Even as her appetite shall play the god With his weak function. How am I then a villain To counsel Cassio to this parallel course, Directly to his good? Divinity of hell! When devils will the blackest sins put on, They do suggest at first with heavenly shows, As I do now; for while this honest fool Plies Desdemona to repair his fortunes, And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor, I'll pour this pestilence into his ear That she repeals him for her body's lust; And, by how much she strives to do him good, She shall undo her credit with the Moor. So will I turn her virtue into pitch, And out of her own goodness make the net That shall enmesh them all. How now, Roderigo! I do follow here in the chase, not like a hound that hunts, but one that fills up the cry. My money is almost spent; I have been to-night exceedingly well cudgelled; and I think the issue will be, I shall have so much experience for my pains; and so, with no money at all and a little more wit, return again to Venice. How poor are they that have not patience! What wound did ever heal but by degrees? Thou know'st we work by wit and not by witchcraft, And wit depends on dilatory time. Does 't not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee, And thou by that small hurt hast cashiered Cassio. Though other things grow fair against the sun, Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe: Content thyself awhile. By the mass, 'tis morning; Pleasure and action make the hours seem short. Retire thee; go where thou art billeted: Away, I say; thou shalt know more hereafter: Nay, get thee gone. Two things are to be done, My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress; I'll set her on; Myself the while to draw the Moor apart, And bring him jump when he may Cassio find Soliciting his wife: ay, that's the way: Dull not device by coldness and delay. Masters, play here, I will content your pains; Something that's brief; and bid 'Good morrow, general.' Why, masters, have your instruments been in Naples, that they speak i' the nose thus? How, sir, how? Are these, I pray you, wind-instruments? Ay, marry, are they, sir. O! thereby hangs a tail. Whereby hangs a tale, sir? Marry, sir, by many a wind-instrument that I know. But, masters, here's money for you; and the general so likes your music, that he desires you, for love's sake, to make no more noise with it. Well, sir, we will not. If you have any music that may not be heard, to 't again; but, as they say, to hear music the general does not greatly care. We have none such, sir. Then put up your pipes in your bag, for I'll away. Go; vanish into air; away! Dost thou hear, mine honest friend? No, I hear not your honest friend; I hear you. Prithee, keep up thy quillets. There's a poor piece of gold for thee. If the gentlewoman that attends the general's wife be stirring, tell her there's one Cassio entreats her a little favour of speech: wilt thou do this? She is stirring, sir: if she will stir hither, I shall seem to notify unto her. Do, good my friend. In happy time, Iago. You have not been a-bed, then? Why, no; the day had broke Before we parted. I have made bold, Iago, To send in to your wife; my suit to her Is, that she will to virtuous Desdemona Procure me some access. I'll send her to you presently; And I'll devise a mean to draw the Moor Out of the way, that your converse and business May be more free. I humbly thank you for 't. I never knew A Florentine more kind and honest. Good morrow, good lieutenant: I am sorry For your displeasure; but all will soon be well. The general and his wife are talking of it, And she speaks for you stoutly: the Moor replies That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus And great affinity, and that in wholesome wisdom He might not but refuse you; but he protests he loves you, And needs no other suitor but his likings To take the saf'st occasion by the front To bring you in again. Yet, I beseech you, If you think fit, or that it may be done, Give me advantage of some brief discourse With Desdemona alone. Pray you, come in: I will bestow you where you shall have time To speak your bosom freely. I am much bound to you. These letters give, Iago, to the pilot, And by him do my duties to the senate; That done, I will be walking on the works; Repair there to me. Well, my good lord, I'll do t. This fortification, gentlemen, shall we see 't? We'll wait upon your lordship. Be thou assur'd, good Cassio, I will do All my abilities in thy behalf. Good madam, do: I warrant it grieves my husband, As if the case were his. O! that's an honest fellow. Do not doubt, Cassio, But I will have my lord and you again As friendly as you were. Bounteous madam, Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio, He's never anything but your true servant. I know 't; I thank you. You do love my lord; You have known him long; and be you well assur'd He shall in strangeness stand no further off Than in a politic distance. Ay, but, lady, That policy may either last so long, Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet, Or breed itself so out of circumstance, That, I being absent and my place supplied, My general will forget my love and service. Do not doubt that; before Emilia here I give thee warrant of thy place. Assure thee, If I do vow a friendship, I'll perform it To the last article; my lord shall never rest; I'll watch him tame, and talk him out of patience; His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift; I'll intermingle every thing he does With Cassio's suit. Therefore be merry, Cassio; For thy solicitor shall rather die Than give thy cause away. Madam, here comes my lord. Madam, I'll take my leave. Why, stay, and hear me speak. Madam, not now; I am very ill at ease, Unfit for mine own purposes. Well, do your discretion. Ha! I like not that. What dost thou say? Nothing, my lord: or ifâ€”I know not what. Was not that Cassio parted from my wife? Cassio, my lord? No, sure, I cannot think it That he would steal away so guilty-like, Seeing you coming. I do believe 'twas he. How now, my lord! I have been talking with a suitor here, A man that languishes in your displeasure. Who is 't you mean? Why, your lieutenant, Cassio. Good my lord, If I have any grace or power to move you, His present reconciliation take; For if he be not one that truly loves you, That errs in ignorance and not in cunning, I have no judgment in an honest face. I prithee call him back. Went he hence now? Ay, sooth; so humbled, That he hath left part of his grief with me, To suffer with him. Good love, call him back. Not now, sweet Desdemona; some other time. But shall 't be shortly? The sooner, sweet, for you. Shall 't be to-night at supper? No, not to-night. To-morrow dinner then? I shall not dine at home; I meet the captains at the citadel. Why then, to-morrow night; or Tuesday morn; On Tuesday noon, or night; on Wednesday morn: I prithee name the time, but let it not Exceed three days: in faith, he's penitent; And yet his trespass, in our common reason,â€” Save that they say, the wars must make examples Out of their best,â€”is not almost a fault To incur a private check. When shall he come? Tell me, Othello: I wonder in my soul, What you could ask me that I should deny, Or stand so mammering on. What! Michael Cassio, That came a wooing with you, and so many a time, When I have spoke of you dispraisingly, Hath ta'en your part; to have so much to do To bring him in! Trust me, I could do much.â€” Prithee, no more; let him come when he will; I will deny thee nothing. Why, this is not a boon; 'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves, Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm, Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit To your own person; nay, when I have a suit Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed, It shall be full of poise and difficult weight, And fearful to be granted. I will deny thee nothing: Whereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this, To leave me but a little to myself. Shall I deny you? no: farewell, my lord. Farewell, my Desdemona: I'll come to thee straight. Emilia, come. Be as your fancies teach you; Whate'er you be, I am obedient. Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul But I do love thee! and when I love thee not, Chaos is come again. My noble lord,â€” What dost thou say, Iago? Did Michael Cassio, when you woo'd my lady, Know of your love? He did, from first to last: why dost thou ask? But for a satisfaction of my thought; No further harm. Why of thy thought, Iago? I did not think he had been acquainted with her. O! yes; and went between us very oft. Indeed! Indeed! ay, indeed; discern'st thou aught in that? Is he not honest? Honest, my lord? Honest! ay, honest. My lord, for aught I know. What dost thou think? Think, my lord! Think, my lord! By heaven, he echoes me, As if there were some monster in his thought Too hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something: I heard thee say but now, thou lik'dst not that, When Cassio left my wife; what didst not like? And when I told thee he was of my counsel In my whole course of wooing, thou criedst, 'Indeed!' And didst contract and purse thy brow together, As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain Some horrible conceit. If thou dost love me, Show me thy thought. My lord, you know I love you. I think thou dost; And, for I know thou art full of love and honesty, And weigh'st thy words before thou giv'st them breath, Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more; For such things in a false disloyal knave Are tricks of custom, but in a man that's just They are close delations, working from the heart That passion cannot rule. For Michael Cassio, I dare be sworn I think that he is honest. I think so too. Men should be what they seem; Or those that be not, would they might seem none! Certain, men should be what they seem. Why then, I think Cassio 's an honest man. Nay, yet there's more in this. I pray thee, speak to me as to thy thinkings, As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts The worst of words. Good my lord, pardon me; Though I am bound to every act of duty, I am not bound to that all slaves are free to. Utter my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and false; As where's that palace whereinto foul things Sometimes intrude not? who has a breast so pure But some uncleanly apprehensions Keep leets and law days, and in session sit With meditations lawful? Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago, If thou but think'st him wrong'd, and mak'st his ear A stranger to thy thoughts. I do beseech you, Though I perchance am vicious in my guess,â€” As, I confess, it is my nature's plague To spy into abuses, and oft my jealousy Shapes faults that are not,â€”that your wisdom yet, From one that so imperfectly conceits, Would take no notice, nor build yourself a trouble Out of his scattering and unsure observance. It were not for your quiet nor your good, Nor for my manhood, honesty, or wisdom, To let you know my thoughts. What dost thou mean? Good name in man and woman, dear my lord, Is the immediate jewel of their souls: Who steals my purse steals trash; 'tis something, nothing; 'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been slave to thousands; But he that filches from me my good name Robs me of that which not enriches him, And makes me poor indeed. By heaven, I'll know thy thoughts. You cannot, if my heart were in your hand; Nor shall not, whilst 'tis in my custody. Ha! O! beware, my lord, of jealousy; It is the green-ey'd monster which doth mock The meat it feeds on; that cuckold lives in bliss Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger; But, O! what damned minutes tells he o'er Who dotes, yet doubts; suspects, yet soundly loves! O misery! Poor and content is rich, and rich enough, But riches fineless is as poor as winter To him that ever fears he shall be poor. Good heaven, the souls of all my tribe defend From jealousy! Why, why is this? Think'st thou I'd make a life of jealousy, To follow still the changes of the moon With fresh suspicions? No; to be once in doubt Is once to be resolved. Exchange me for a goat When I shall turn the business of my soul To such exsufflicate and blown surmises, Matching thy inference. 'Tis not to make me jealous To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company, Is free of speech, sings, plays, and dances well; Where virtue is, these are more virtuous: Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw The smallest fear, or doubt of her revolt; For she had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago; I'll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove; And, on the proof, there is no more but this, Away at once with love or jealousy! I am glad of it; for now I shall have reason To show the love and duty that I bear you With franker spirit; therefore, as I am bound, Receive it from me; I speak not yet of proof. Look to your wife; observe her well with Cassio; Wear your eye thus, not jealous nor secure: I would not have your free and noble nature Out of self-bounty be abus'd; look to 't: I know our country disposition well; In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks They dare not show their husbands; their best conscience Is not to leave 't undone, but keep 't unknown. Dost thou say so? She did deceive her father, marrying you: And when she seem'd to shake and fear your looks, She lov'd them most. And so she did. Why, go to, then; She that so young could give out such a seeming, To seel her father's eyes up close as oak, He thought 'twas witchcraft; but I am much to blame; I humbly do beseech you of your pardon For too much loving you. I am bound to thee for ever. I see, this hath a little dash'd your spirits. Not a jot, not a jot. I' faith, I fear it has. I hope you will consider what is spoke Comes from my love. But, I do see you're mov'd; I am to pray you not to strain my speech To grosser issues nor to larger reach Than to suspicion. I will not. Should you do so, my lord, My speech should fall into such vile success As my thoughts aim not at. Cassio's my worthy friendâ€” My lord, I see you're mov'd. No, not much mov'd: I do not think but Desdemona's honest. Long live she so! and long live you to think so! And, yet, how nature erring from itself,â€” Ay, there's the point: as, to be bold with you, Not to affect many proposed matches Of her own clime, complexion, and degree, Whereto, we see, in all things nature tends; Foh! one may smell in such, a will most rank, Foul disproportion, thoughts unnatural. But pardon me; I do not in position Distinctly speak of her, though I may fear Her will, recoiling to her better judgment, May fail to match you with her country forms And happily repent. Farewell, farewell: If more thou dost perceive, let me know more; Set on thy wife to observe. Leave me, Iago. My lord, I take my leave. Why did I marry? This honest creature, doubtless, Sees and knows more, much more, than he unfolds. My lord, I would I might entreat your honour To scan this thing no further; leave it to time. Although 'tis fit that Cassio have his place, For, sure he fills it up with great ability, Yet, if you please to hold him off awhile, You shall by that perceive him and his means: Note if your lady strain his entertainment With any strong or vehement importunity; Much will be seen in that. In the mean time, Let me be thought too busy in my fears, As worthy cause I have to fear I am, And hold her free, I do beseech your honour. Fear not my government. I once more take my leave. This fellow's of exceeding honesty, And knows all qualities, with a learned spirit, Of human dealings; if I do prove her haggard, Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings, I'd whistle her off and let her down the wind, To prey at fortune. Haply, for I am black, And have not those soft parts of conversation That chamberers have, or, for I am declin'd Into the vale of yearsâ€”yet that's not muchâ€” She's gone, I am abus'd; and my relief Must be to loathe her. O curse of marriage! That we can call these delicate creatures ours, And not their appetites. I had rather be a toad, And live upon the vapour of a dungeon, Than keep a corner in the thing I love For others' uses. Yet, 'tis the plague of great ones; Prerogativ'd are they less than the base; 'Tis destiny unshunnable, like death: Even then this forked plague is fated to us When we do quicken. Look! where she comes. If she be false, O! then heaven mocks itself. I'll not believe it. How now, my dear Othello! Your dinner and the generous islanders By you invited, do attend your presence. I am to blame. Why do you speak so faintly? Are you not well? I have a pain upon my forehead here. Faith, that's with watching; 'twill away again: Let me but bind it hard, within this hour It will be well. Your napkin is too little: Let it alone. Come, I'll go in with you. I am very sorry that you are not well. I am glad I have found this napkin; This was her first remembrance from the Moor; My wayward husband hath a hundred times Woo'd me to steal it, but she so loves the token, For he conjur'd her she should ever keep it, That she reserves it evermore about her To kiss and talk to. I'll have the work ta'en out, And give 't Iago: What he will do with it heaven knows, not I; I nothing but to please his fantasy. How now! what do you here alone? Do not you chide; I have a thing for you. A thing for me? It is a common thingâ€” Ha! To have a foolish wife. O! is that all? What will you give me now For that same handkerchief? What handkerchief? What handkerchief! Why, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona: That which so often you did bid me steal. Hast stol'n it from her? No, faith; she let it drop by negligence, And, to the advantage, I, being there, took't up. Look, here it is. A good wench; give it me. What will you do with 't, that you have been so earnest To have me filch it? Why, what's that to you? If it be not for some purpose of import Give 't me again; poor lady! she'll run mad When she shall lack it. Be not acknown on 't; I have use for it. Go, leave me. I will in Cassio's lodging lose this napkin, And let him find it; trifles light as air Are to the jealous confirmations strong As proofs of holy writ; this may do something. The Moor already changes with my poison: Dangerous conceits are in their natures poisons, Which at the first are scarce found to distaste, But with a little act upon the blood, Burn like the mines of sulphur. I did say so: Look! where he comes! Not poppy, nor mandragora, Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world, Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep Which thou ow'dst yesterday. Ha! ha! false to me? Why, how now, generall no more of that. Avaunt! be gone! thou hast set me on the rack; I swear 'tis better to be much abus'd Than but to know 't a little. How now, my lord! What sense had I of her stol'n hours of lust? I saw 't not, thought it not, it harm'd not me; I slept the next night well, was free and merry; I found not Cassio's kisses on her lips; He that is robb'd, not wanting what is stol'n, Let him not know 't and he's not robb'd at all. I am sorry to hear this. I had been happy, if the general camp, Pioners and all, had tasted her sweet body, So I had nothing known. O! now, for ever Farewell the tranquil mind; farewell content! Farewell the plumed troop and the big wars That make ambition virtue! O, farewell! Farewell the neighing steed, and the shrill trump, The spirit-stirring drum, the ear-piercing fife, The royal banner, and all quality, Pride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious war! And, O you mortal engines, whose rude throats The immortal Jove's dread clamours counterfeit, Farewell! Othello's occupation's gone! Is it possible, my lord? Villain, be sure thou prove my love a whore, Be sure of it; give me the ocular proof; Or, by the worth of mine eternal soul, Thou hadst been better have been born a dog Than answer my wak'd wrath. Is 't come to this? Make me to see 't; or, at the least, so prove it, That the probation bear no hinge nor loop To hang a doubt on; or woe upon thy life! My noble lord,â€” If thou dost slander her and torture me, Never pray more; abandon all remorse; On horror's head horrors accumulate; Do deeds to make heaven weep, all earth amaz'd; For nothing canst thou to damnation add Greater than that. O grace! O heaven forgive me! Are you a man! have you a soul or sense? God be wi' you; take mine office. O wretched fool! That liv'st to make thine honesty a vice. O monstrous world! Take note, take note, O world! To be direct and honest is not safe. I thank you for this profit, and, from hence I'll love no friend, sith love breeds such offence. Nay, stay; thou shouldst be honest. I should be wise; for honesty's a fool, And loses that it works for. By the world, I think my wife be honest and think she is not; I think that thou art just and think thou art not. I'll have some proof. Her name, that was as fresh As Dian's visage, is now begrim'd and black As mine own face. If there be cords or knives, Poison or fire or suffocating streams, I'll not endure it. Would I were satisfied! I see, sir, you are eaten up with passion. I do repent me that I put it to you. You would be satisfied? Would! nay, I will. And may; but how? how satisfied, my lord? Would you, the supervisor, grossly gape on; Behold her tupp'd? Death and damnation! O! It were a tedious difficulty, I think, To bring them to that prospect; damn them then, If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster More than their own! What then? how then? What shall I say? Where's satisfaction? It is impossible you should see this, Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys, As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross As ignorance made drunk; but yet, I say, If imputation, and strong circumstances, Which lead directly to the door of truth, Will give you satisfaction, you may have it. Give me a living reason she's disloyal. I do not like the office; But, sith I am enter'd in this cause so far, Prick'd to 't by foolish honesty and love, I will go on. I lay with Cassio lately; And, being troubled with a raging tooth, I could not sleep. There are a kind of men so loose of soul That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs; One of this kind is Cassio. In sleep I heard him say, 'Sweet Desdemona, Let us be wary, let us hide our loves!' And then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand, Cry, 'O, sweet creature!' and then kiss me hard, As if he pluck'd up kisses by the roots, That grew upon my lips; then laid his leg Over my thigh, and sigh'd, and kiss'd; and then Cried, 'Cursed fate, that gave thee to the Moor!' O monstrous! monstrous! Nay, this was but his dream. But this denoted a foregone conclusion: 'Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream. And this may help to thicken other proofs That do demonstrate thinly. I'll tear her all to pieces. Nay, but be wise; yet we see nothing done; She may be honest yet. Tell me but this: Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief Spotted with strawberries in your wife's hand? I gave her such a one; 'twas my first gift. I know not that; but such a handkerchiefâ€” I am sure it was your wife'sâ€”did I to-day See Cassio wipe his beard with. If it be that,â€” If it be that, or any that was hers, It speaks against her with the other proofs. O! that the slave had forty thousand lives; One is too poor, too weak for my revenge. Now do I see 'tis true. Look here, Iago; All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven: 'Tis gone. Arise, black vengeance, from the hollow hell! Yield up, O love! thy crown and hearted throne To tyrannous hate. Swell, bosom, with thy fraught, For 'tis of aspics' tongues! Yet be content. O! blood, blood, blood! Patience, I say; your mind, perhaps, may change. Never, Iago. Like to the Pontick sea, Whose icy current and compulsive course Ne'er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on To the Propontic and the Hellespont, Even so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace, Shall ne'er look back, ne'er ebb to humble love, Till that a capable and wide revenge Swallow them up. Now, by yond marble heaven, In the due reverence of a sacred vow I here engage my words. Do not rise yet. Witness, you ever-burning lights above! You elements that clip us round about! Witness, that here Iago doth give up The execution of his wit, hands, heart, To wrong'd Othello's service! Let him command, And to obey shall be in me remorse, What bloody business ever. I greet thy love, Not with vain thanks, but with acceptance bounteous, And will upon the instant put thee to 't: Within these three days let me hear thee say That Cassio's not alive. My friend is dead; 'tis done at your request: But let her live. Damn her, lewd minx! O, damn her! Come, go with me apart; I will withdraw To furnish me with some swift means of death For the fair devil. Now art thou my lieutenant. I am your own for ever. Do you know, sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio lies? I dare not say he lies any where. Why, man? He is a soldier; and for one to say a soldier lies, is stabbing. Go to; where lodges he? To tell you where he lodges is to tell you where I lie. Can anything be made of this? I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise a lodging, and say he lies here or he lies there, were to lie in mine own throat. Can you inquire him out, and be edified by report? I will catechize the world for him; that is, make questions, and by them answer. Seek him, bid him come hither; tell him I have moved my lord in his behalf, and hope all will be well. To do this is within the compass of man's wit, and therefore I will attempt the doing it. Where should I lose that handkerchief, Emilia? I know not, madam. Believe me, I had rather have lost my purse Full of cruzadoes; and, but my noble Moor Is true of mind, and made of no such baseness As jealous creatures are, it were enough To put him to ill thinking. Is he not jealous? Who! he? I think the sun where he was born Drew all such humours from him. Look! where he comes. I will not leave him now till Cassio Be call'd to him. How is 't with you, my lord? Well, my good lady. O! hardness to dissemble. How do you, Desdemona? Well, my good lord. Give me your hand. This hand is moist, my lady. It yet has felt no age nor known no sorrow. This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart; Hot, hot, and moist; this hand of yours requires A sequester from liberty, fasting and prayer, Much castigation, exercise devout; For here's a young and sweating devil here, That commonly rebels. 'Tis a good hand, A frank one. You may, indeed, say so; For 'twas that hand that gave away my heart. A liberal hand; the hearts of old gave hands, But our new heraldry is hands not hearts. I cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise. What promise, chuck? I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you. I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me. Lend me thy handkerchief. Here, my lord. That which I gave you. I have it not about me. Not? No, indeed, my lord. That is a fault. That handkerchief Did an Egyptian to my mother give; She was a charmer, and could almost read The thoughts of people; she told her, while she kept it, 'Twould make her amiable and subdue my father Entirely to her love, but if she lost it Or made a gift of it, my father's eye Should hold her loathed, and his spirits should hunt After new fancies. She dying gave it me; And bid me, when my fate would have me wive, To give it her. I did so: and take heed on 't; Make it a darling like your precious eye; To lose't or give't away, were such perdition As nothing else could match. Is 't possible? 'Tis true; there's magic in the web of it; A sibyl, that had number'd in the world The sun to course two hundred compasses, In her prophetic fury sew'd the work; The worms were hallow'd that did breed the silk, And it was dy'd in mummy which the skilful Conserv'd of maidens' hearts. Indeed! is 't true? Most veritable; therefore look to 't well. Then would to heaven that I had never seen it! Ha! wherefore? Why do you speak so startingly and rash? Is 't lost? is 't gone? speak, is it out o' the way? Heaven bless us! Say you? It is not lost: but what an if it were? How! I say, it is not lost. Fetch 't, let me see 't. Why, so I can, sir, but I will not now. This is a trick to put me from my suit: Pray you let Cassio be receiv'd again. Fetch me the handkerchief; my mind misgives. Come, come; You'll never meet a more sufficient man. The handkerchief! I pray, talk me of Cassio. The handkerchief! A man that all his time Hath founded his good fortunes on your love, Shar'd dangers with you,â€” The handkerchief! In sooth you are to blame. Away! Is not this man jealous? I ne'er saw this before. Sure, there's some wonder in this handkerchief; I am most unhappy in the loss of it. 'Tis not a year or two shows us a man; They are all but stomachs, and we all but food; They eat us hungerly, and when they are full They belch us. Look you! Cassio and my husband. There is no other way; 'tis she must do 't: And, lo! the happiness: go and importune her. How now, good Cassio! what's the news with you? Madam, my former suit: I do beseech you That by your virtuous means I may again Exist, and be a member of his love Whom I with all the office of my heart Entirely honour; I would not be delay'd. If my offence be of such mortal kind That nor my service past, nor present sorrows, Nor purpos'd merit in futurity, Can ransom me into his love again, But to know so must be my benefit; So shall I clothe me in a forc'd content, And shut myself up in some other course To fortune's alms. Alas! thrice-gentle Cassio! My advocation is not now in tune; My lord is not my lord; nor should I know him, Were he in favour as in humour alter'd. So help me every spirit sanctified, As I have spoken for you all my best And stood within the blank of his displeasure For my free speech. You must awhile be patient; What I can do I will, and more I will Than for myself I dare: let that suffice you. Is my lord angry? He went hence but now, And, certainly in strange unquietness. Can he be angry? I have seen the cannon, When it hath blown his ranks into the air, And, like the devil, from his very arm Puff'd his own brother; and can he be angry? Something of moment then; I will go meet him; There's matter in 't indeed, if he be angry. I prithee, do so. Something, sure, of state, Either from Venice, or some unhatch'd practice Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him, Hath puddled his clear spirit; and, in such cases Men's natures wrangle with inferior things, Though great ones are their object. 'Tis even so; For let our finger ache, and it indues Our other healthful members ev'n to that sense Of pain. Nay, we must think men are not gods, Nor of them look for such observancy As fits the bridal. Beshrew me much, Emilia, I wasâ€”unhandsome warrior as I amâ€” Arraigning his unkindness with my soul; But now I find I had suborn'd the witness, And he's indicted falsely. Pray heaven it be state-matters, as you think, And no conception, nor no jealous toy Concerning you. Alas the day! I never gave him cause. But jealous souls will not be answer'd so; They are not ever jealous for the cause, But jealous for they are jealous; 'tis a monster Begot upon itself, born on itself. Heaven keep that monster from Othello's mind! Lady, amen. I will go seek him. Cassio, walk hereabout; If I do find him fit, I'll move your suit And seek to effect it to my uttermost. I humbly thank your ladyship. Save you, friend Cassio! What make you from home? How is it with you, my most fair Bianca? I' faith, sweet love, I was coming to your house. And I was going to your lodging, Cassio. What! keep a week away? seven days and nights? Eight score eight hours? and lovers' absent hours, More tedious than the dial eight score times? O weary reckoning! Pardon me, Bianca, I have this while with leaden thoughts been press'd, But I shall, in a more continuate time, Strike off this score of absence. Sweet Bianca. Take me this work out. O Cassio! whence came this? This is some token from a newer friend; To the felt absence now I feel a cause; Is 't come to this? Well, well. Go to, woman! Throw your vile guesses in the devil's teeth, From whence you have them. You are jealous now That this is from some mistress, some remembrance: No, in good troth, Bianca. Why, whose is it? I know not, sweet; I found it in my chamber. I like the work well; ere it be demanded,â€” As like enough it will,â€”I'd have it copied; Take it and do 't; and leave me for this time. Leave you! wherefore? I do attend here on the general, And think it no addition nor my wish To have him see me woman'd. Why, I pray you? Not that I love you not. But that you do not love me. I pray you, bring me on the way a little And say if I shall see you soon at night. 'Tis but a little way that I can bring you, For I attend here; but I'll see you soon. 'Tis very good; I must be circumstanc'd. Will you think so? Think so, Iago! What! To kiss in private? An unauthoriz'd kiss. Or to be naked with her friend a-bed An hour or more, not meaning any harm? Naked a-bed, Iago, and not mean harm? It is hypocrisy against the devil: They that mean virtuously, and yet do so, The devil their virtue tempts, and they tempt heaven. If they do nothing, 'tis a venial slip; But if I give my wife a handkerchief,â€” What then? Why, then, 'tis hers, my lord; and, being hers, She may, I think, bestow 't on any man. She is protectress of her honour too; May she give that? Her honour is an essence that's not seen; They have it very oft that have it not: But for the handkerchief,â€” By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it:â€” Thou said'st,â€”O! it comes o'er my memory, As doth the raven o'er the infected house, Boding to all,â€”he had my handkerchief. Ay, what of that? That's not so good now. What, If I had said I had seen him do you wrong? Or heard him say, as knaves be such abroad, Who having, by their own importunate suit, Or voluntary dotage of some mistress, Convinced or supplied them, cannot choose But they must blab. Hath he said any thing? He hath, my lord; but be you well assur'd, No more than he'll unswear. What hath he said? Faith, that he didâ€”I know not what he did. What? what? Lieâ€” With her? With her, on her; what you will. Lie with her! lie on her! We say, lie on her, when they belie her. Lie with her! that's fulsome. Handkerchief,â€”confessions,â€”handkerchief! To confess, and be hanged for his labour. First, to be hanged, and then to confess: I tremble at it. Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing passion without some instruction. It is not words that shake me thus. Pish! Noses, ears, and lips. Is it possible?â€”Confess!â€”Handkerchief!â€”O devil! Work on, My medicine, work! Thus credulous fools are caught; And many worthy and chaste dames even thus, All guitless, meet reproach. What, ho! my lord! My lord, I say! Othello! How now, Cassio! What's the matter? My lord is fallen into an epilepsy; This is his second fit; he had one yesterday. Rub him about the temples. No, forbear; The lethargy must have his quiet course, If not he foams at mouth, and by and by Breaks out to savage madness. Look! he stirs; Do you withdraw yourself a little while, He will recover straight; when he is gone, I would on great occasion speak with you. How is it, general? have you not hurt your head? Dost thou mock me? I mock you! no, by heaven. Would you would bear your fortune like a man! A horned man's a monster and a beast. There's many a beast then, in a populous city, And many a civil monster. Did he confess it? Good sir, be a man; Think every bearded fellow that's but yok'd May draw with you; there's millions now alive That nightly lie in those unproper beds Which they dare swear peculiar; your case is better. O! 'tis the spite of hell, the fiend's arch-mock, To lip a wanton in a secure couch, And to suppose her chaste. No, let me know; And knowing what I am I know what she shall be. O! thou art wise; 'tis certain. Stand you awhile apart; Confine yourself but in a patient list. Whilst you were here o'erwhelmed with your grief,â€” A passion most unsuiting such a man,â€” Cassio came hither; I shifted him away, And laid good 'scuse upon your ecstasy; Bade him anon return and here speak with me; The which he promis'd. Do but encave yourself, And mark the fleers, the gibes, and notable scorns, That dwell in every region of his face; For I will make him tell the tale anew, Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and when He hath, and is again to cope your wife: I say, but mark his gesture. Marry, patience; Or I shall say you are all in all in spleen, And nothing of a man. Dost thou hear, Iago? I will be found most cunning in my patience; Butâ€”dost thou hear?â€”most bloody. That's not amiss; But yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw? Now will I question Cassio of Bianca, A housewife that by selling her desires Buys herself bread and clothes; it is a creature That dotes on Cassio; as 'tis the strumpet's plague To beguile many and be beguil'd by one. He, when he hears of her, cannot refrain From the excess of laughter. Here he comes: As he shall smile, Othello shall go mad; And his unbookish jealousy must construe Poor Cassio's smiles, gestures, and light behaviour Quite in the wrong. How do you now, lieutenant? The worser that you give me the addition Whose want even kills me. Ply Desdemona well, and you are sure on 't. Now, if this suit lay in Bianca's power, How quickly should you speed! Alas! poor caitiff! Look! how he laughs already! I never knew woman love man so. Alas! poor rogue, I think, i' faith, she loves me. Now he denies it faintly, and laughs it out. Do you hear, Cassio? Now he importunes him To tell it o'er: go to; well said, well said. She gives it out that you shall marry her; Do you intend it? Ha, ha, ha! Do you triumph, Roman? do you triumph? I marry her! what? a customer? I prithee, bear some charity to my wit; do not think it so unwholesome. Ha, ha, ha! So, so, so, so. They laugh that win. Faith, the cry goes that you shall marry her. Prithee, say true. I am a very villain else. Have you scored me? Well. This is the monkey's own giving out: she is persuaded I will marry her, out of her own love and flattery, not out of my promise. Iago beckons me; now he begins the story. She was here even now; she haunts me in every place. I was the other day talking on the sea bank with certain Venetians, and thither come this bauble, and, by this hand, she falls me thus about my neck;â€” Crying, 'O dear Cassio!' as it were; his gesture imports it. So hangs and lolls and weeps upon me; so hales and pulls me; ha, ha, ha! Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber. O! I see that nose of yours, but not the dog I shall throw it to. Well, I must leave her company. Before me! look, where she comes. 'Tis such another fitchew! marry, a perfumed one. What do you mean by this haunting of me? Let the devil and his dam haunt you! What did you mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now? I was a fine fool to take it. I must take out the work! A likely piece of work, that you should find it in your chamber, and not know who left it there! This is some minx's token, and I must take out the work! There, give it your hobby-horse; wheresoever you had it I'll take out no work on 't. How now, my sweet Bianca! how now, how now! By heaven, that should be my handkerchief! An you'll come to supper to-night, you may; an you will not, come when you are next prepared for. After her, after her. Faith, I must; she'll rail in the street else. Will you sup there? Faith, I intend so. Well, I may chance to see you, for I would very fain speak with you. Prithee, come; will you? Go to; say no more. How shall I murder him, Iago? Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice? O! Iago! And did you see the handkerchief? Was that mine? Yours, by this hand; and to see how he prizes the foolish woman your wife! she gave it him, and he hath given it his whore. I would have him nine years a-killing. A fine woman! a fair woman! a sweet woman! Nay, you must forget that. Ay, let her rot, and perish, and be damned to-night; for she shall not live. No, my heart is turned to stone; I strike it, and it hurts my hand. O! the world hath not a sweeter creature; she might lie by an emperor's side and command him tasks. Nay, that's not your way. Hang her! I do but say what she is. So delicate with her needle! An admirable musician! O, she will sing the savageness out of a bear. Of so high and plenteous wit and invention! She's the worse for all this. O! a thousand, a thousand times. And then, of so gentle a condition! Ay, too gentle. Nay, that's certain;â€”but yet the pity of it, Iago! O! Iago, the pity of it, Iago! If you are so fond over her iniquity, give her patent to offend; for, if it touch not you, it comes near nobody. I will chop her into messes. Cuckold me! O! 'tis foul in her. With mine officer! That's fouler. Get me some poison, Iago; this night: I'll not expostulate with her, lest her body and beauty unprovide my mind again. This night, Iago. Do it not with poison, strangle her in her bed, even the bed she hath contaminated. Good, good; the justice of it pleases; very good. And for Cassio, let me be his undertaker; you shall hear more by midnight. Excellent good. What trumpet is that same? Something from Venice, sure. 'Tis Lodovico, Come from the duke; and see, your wife is with him. God save you, worthy general! With all my heart, sir. The duke and senators of Venice greet you. I kiss the instrument of their pleasures. And what's the news, good cousin Lodovico? I am very glad to see you, signior; Welcome to Cyprus. I thank you. How does Lieutenant Cassio? Lives, sir. Cousin, there's fall'n between him and my lord An unkind breach; but you shall make all well. Are you sure of that? My lord? This fail you not to do, as you willâ€” He did not call; he's busy in the paper. Is there division 'twixt my lord and Cassio? A most unhappy one; I would do much To atone them, for the love I bear to Cassio. Fire and brimstone! My lord? Are you wise? What! is he angry? May be the letter mov'd him; For, as I think, they do command him home, Deputing Cassio in his government. Trust me, I am glad on 't. Indeed! My lord? I am glad to see you mad. Why, sweet Othello? Devil! I have not deserved this. My lord, this would not be believ'd in Venice, Though I should swear I saw 't: 'tis very much; Make her amends, she weeps. O devil, devil! If that the earth could teem with woman's tears, Each drop she falls would prove a crocodile. Out of my sight! I will not stay to offend you. Truly, an obedient lady; I do beseech your lordship, call her back. Mistress! My lord? What would you with her, sir? Who, I, my lord? Ay; you did wish that I would make her turn: Sir, she can turn, and turn, and yet go on, And turn again; and she can weep, sir, weep; And she's obedient, as you say, obedient, Very obedient. Proceed you in your tears. Concerning this, sir,â€”O well-painted passion!â€” I am commanded home. Get you away; I'll send for you anon. Sir, I obey the mandate, And will return to Venice. Hence! avaunt! Cassio shall have my place. And, sir, to-night, I do entreat that we may sup together; You are welcome, sir, to Cyprus. Goats and monkeys! Is this the noble Moor whom our full senate Call all-in-all sufficient? is this the noble nature Whom passion could not shake? whose solid virtue The shot of accident nor dart of chance Could neither graze nor pierce? He is much chang'd. Are his wits safe? is he not light of brain? He's that he is; I may not breathe my censure. What he might be, if, what he might, he is not, I would to heaven he were! What! strike his wife! Faith, that was not so well; yet would I knew That stroke would prove the worst! Is it his use? Or did the letters work upon his blood, And new-create this fault? Alas, alas! It is not honesty in me to speak What I have seen and known. You shall observe him, And his own courses will denote him so That I may save my speech. Do but go after And mark how he continues. I am sorry that I am deceiv'd in him. You have seen nothing, then? Nor ever heard, nor ever did suspect. Yes, you have seen Cassio and her together. But then I saw no harm, and then I heard Each syllable that breath made up between them. What! did they never whisper? Never, my lord. Nor send you out o' the way? Never. To fetch her fan, her gloves, her mask, nor nothing? Never, my lord. That's strange. I durst, my lord, to wager she is honest, Lay down my soul at stake: if you think other, Remove your thought; it doth abuse your bosom. If any wretch have put this in your head, Let heaven requite it with the serpent's curse! For, if she be not honest, chaste, and true, There's no man happy; the purest of their wives Is foul as slander. Bid her come hither; go. She says enough; yet she's a simple bawd That cannot say as much. This is a subtle whore, A closet lock and key of villanous secrets; And yet she'll kneel and pray; I have seen her do 't. My lord, what is your will? Pray, chuck, come hither. What is your pleasure? Let me see your eyes; Look in my face. What horrible fancy's this? Some of your function, mistress; Leave procreants alone and shut the door; Cough or cry 'hem' if any body come; Your mystery, your mystery; nay, dispatch. Upon my knees, what doth your speech import? I understand a fury in your words, But not the words. Why, what art thou? Your wife, my lord; your true And loyal wife. Come, swear it, damn thyself; Lest, being like one of heaven, the devils themselves Should fear to seize thee; therefore be double-damn'd; Swear thou art honest. Heaven doth truly know it. Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell. To whom, my lord? with whom? how am I false? Ah! Desdemona; away, away, away! Alas, the heavy day!â€”Why do you weep? Am I the motive of these tears, my lord? If haply you my father do suspect An instrument of this your calling back, Lay not your blame on me; if you have lost him, Why, I have lost him too. Had it pleas'd heaven To try me with affliction, had he rain'd All kinds of sores, and shames, on my bare head, Steep'd me in poverty to the very lips, Given to captivity me and my utmost hopes, I should have found in some part of my soul A drop of patience; but, alas! to make me The fixed figure for the time of scorn To point his slow and moving finger at; Yet could I bear that too; well, very well: But there, where I have garner'd up my heart, Where either I must live or bear no life, The fountain from the which my current runs Or else dries up; to be discarded thence! Or keep it as a cistern for foul toads To knot and gender in! Turn thy complexion there, Patience, thou young and rose-lipp'd cherubin; Ay, there, look grim as hell! I hope my noble lord esteems me honest. O! ay; as summer flies are in the shambles, That quicken even with blowing. O thou weed! Who art so lovely fair and smell'st so sweet That the sense aches at thee, would thou hadst ne'er been born. Alas! what ignorant sin have I committed? Was this fair paper, this most goodly book, Made to write 'whore' upon? What committed! Committed! O thou public commoner! I should make very forges of my cheeks, That would to cinders burn up modesty, Did I but speak thy deeds. What committed! Heaven stops the nose at it and the moon winks, The bawdy wind that kisses all it meets Is hush'd within the hollow mine of earth, And will not hear it. What committed! Impudent strumpet! By heaven, you do me wrong. Are not you a strumpet? No, as I am a Christian. If to preserve this vessel for my lord From any other foul unlawful touch Be not to be a strumpet, I am none. What! not a whore? No, as I shall be sav'd. Is it possible? O! heaven forgive us. I cry you mercy, then; I took you for that cunning whore of Venice That married with Othello. You, mistress, That have the office opposite to Saint Peter, And keep the gate of hell! You, you, ay, you! We have done our course; there's money for your pains. I pray you, turn the key and keep our counsel. Alas! what does this gentleman conceive? How do you, madam? how do you, my good lady? Faith, half asleep. Good madam, what's the matter with my lord? With who? Why, with my lord, madam. Who is thy lord? He that is yours, sweet lady. I have none; do not talk to me, Emilia; I cannot weep, nor answer have I none, But what should go by water. Prithee, to-night Lay on my bed my wedding sheets: remember: And call thy husband hither. Here is a change indeed! 'Tis meet I should be us'd so, very meet. How have I been behav'd, that he might stick The small'st opinion on my least misuse? What is your pleasure, madam? How is it with you? I cannot tell. Those that do teach young babes Do it with gentle means and easy tasks; He might have chid me so; for, in good faith, I am a child to chiding. What's the matter, lady? Alas! Iago, my lord hath so bewhor'd her, Thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her, As true hearts cannot bear. Am I that name, Iago? What name, fair lady? Such as she says my lord did say I was. He call'd her whore; a beggar in his drink Could not have laid such terms upon his callat. Why did he so? I do not know; I am sure I am none such. Do not weep, do not weep. Alas the day! Has she forsook so many noble matches, Her father and her country and her friends, To be call'd whore? would it not make one weep? It is my wretched fortune. Beshrew him for it! How comes this trick upon him? Nay, heaven doth know. I will be hang'd, if some eternal villain, Some busy and insinuating rogue, Some cogging cozening slave, to get some office, Have not devis'd this slander; I'll be hang'd else. Fie! there is no such man; it is impossible. If any such there be, heaven pardon him! A halter pardon him, and hell gnaw his bones! Why should he call her whore? who keeps her company? What place? what time? what form? what likelihood? The Moor's abus'd by some most villanous knave, Some base notorious knave, some scurvy fellow. O heaven! that such companions thou'dst unfold, And put in every honest hand a whip To lash the rascals naked through the world, Even from the east to the west! Speak within door. O! fie upon them. Some such squire he was That turn'd your wit the seamy side without, And made you to suspect me with the Moor. You are a fool; go to. O good Iago, What shall I do to win my lord again? Good friend, go to him; for, by this light of heaven, I know not how I lost him. Here I kneel: If e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his love, Either in discourse of thought or actual deed, Or that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense, Delighted them in any other form; Or that I do not yet, and ever did, And ever will, though he do shake me off To beggarly divorcement, love him dearly, Comfort forswear me! Unkindness may do much; And his unkindness may defeat my life, But never taint my love. I cannot say 'whore:' It does abhor me now I speak the word; To do the act that might the addition earn Not the world's mass of vanity could make me. I pray you be content, 'tis but his humour; The business of the state does him offence, And he does chide with you. If 'twere no other,â€” 'Tis but so, I warrant. Hark! how these instruments summon to supper; The messengers of Venice stay the meat: Go in, and weep not; all things shall be well. How now, Roderigo! I do not find that thou dealest justly with me. What in the contrary? Every day thou daffest me with some device, Iago; and rather, as it seems to me now, keepest from me all conveniency, than suppliest me with the least advantage of hope. I will indeed no longer endure it, nor am I yet persuaded to put up in peace what already I have foolishly suffered. Will you hear me, Roderigo? Faith, I have heard too much, for your words and performances are no kin together. You charge me most unjustly. With nought but truth. I have wasted myself out of my means. The jewels you have had from me to deliver to Desdemona would half have corrupted a votarist; you have told me she has received them, and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden respect and acquaintance, but I find none. Well; go to; very well. Very well! go to! I cannot go to, man; nor 'tis not very well: by this hand, I say, it is very scurvy, and begin to find myself fobbed in it. Very well. I tell you 'tis not very well. I will make myself known to Desdemona; if she will return me my jewels, I will give over my suit and repent my unlawful solicitation; if not, assure yourself I will seek satisfaction of you. You have said now. Ay, and said nothing, but what I protest intendment of doing. Why, now I see there's mettle in thee, and even from this instant do build on thee a better opinion than ever before. Give me thy hand, Roderigo; thou hast taken against me a most just exception; but yet, I protest, I have dealt most directly in thy affair. It hath not appeared. I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your suspicion is not without wit and judgment. But, Roderigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed, which I have greater reason to believe now than ever, I mean purpose, courage, and valour, this night show it: if thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona, take me from this world with treachery and devise engines for my life. Well, what is it? is it within reason and compass? Sir, there is especial commission come from Venice to depute Cassio in Othello's place. Is that true? why, then Othello and Desdemona return again to Venice. O, no! he goes into Mauritania, and takes away with him the fair Desdemona, unless his abode be lingered here by some accident; wherein none can be so determinate as the removing of Cassio. How do you mean, removing of him? Why, by making him uncapable of Othello's place; knocking out his brains. And that you would have me do? Ay; if you dare do yourself a profit and a right. He sups to-night with a harlotry, and thither will I go to him; he knows not yet of his honourable fortune. If you will watch his going thence,â€”which I will fashion to fall out between twelve and one,â€”you may take him at your pleasure; I will be near to second your attempt, and he shall fall between us. Come, stand not amazed at it, but go along with me; I will show you such a necessity in his death that you shall think yourself bound to put it on him. It is now high supper-time, and the night grows to waste; about it. I will hear further reason for this. And you shall be satisfied. I do beseech you, sir, trouble yourself no further. O! pardon me; 'twill do me good to walk. Madam, good night; I humbly thank your ladyship. Your honour is most welcome. Will you walk, sir? O! Desdemona,â€” My lord? Get you to bed on the instant; I will be returned forthwith; dismiss your attendant there; look it be done. I will, my lord. How goes it now? he looks gentler than he did. He says he will return incontinent; He hath commanded me to go to bed, And bade me to dismiss you. Dismiss me! It was his bidding; therefore, good Emilia, Give me my nightly wearing, and adieu: We must not now displease him. I would you had never seen him. So would not I; my love doth so approve him, That even his stubbornness, his checks and frowns,â€” Prithee, unpin me,â€”have grace and favour in them. I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed. All's one. Good faith! how foolish are our minds! If I do die before thee, prithee, shroud me In one of those same sheets. Come, come, you talk. My mother had a maid call'd Barbara; She was in love, and he she lov'd prov'd mad And did forsake her; she had a song of 'willow;' An old thing 'twas, but it express'd her fortune, And she died singing it; that song to-night Will not go from my mind; I have much to do But to go hang my head all at one side, And sing it like poor Barbara. Prithee, dispatch. Shall I go fetch your night-gown? No, unpin me here. This Lodovico is a proper man. A very handsome man. He speaks well. I know a lady in Venice would have walked barefoot to Palestine for a touch of his nether lip. The poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree, Sing all a green willow; Her hand on her bosom, her head on her knee, Sing willow, willow, willow: The fresh streams ran by her, and murmur'd her moans; Sing willow, willow, willow: Her salt tears fell from her, and soften'd the stones;â€” Lay by these:â€” Sing willow, willow, willow: Prithee, hie thee; he'll come anon.â€” Sing all a green willow must be my garland. Let nobody blame him, his scorn I approve,â€” Nay, that's not next. Hark! who is it that knocks? It is the wind. I call'd my love false love; but what said he then? Sing willow, willow, willow: If I court moe women, you'll couch with moe men. So, get thee gone; good night. Mine eyes do itch; Doth that bode weeping? 'Tis neither here nor there. I have heard it said so. O! these men, these men! Dost thou in conscience think, tell me, Emilia, That there be women do abuse their husbands In such gross kind? There be some such, no question. Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world? Why, would not you? No, by this heavenly light! Nor I neither by this heavenly light; might do 't as well i' the dark. Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world? The world is a huge thing; 'tis a great price For a small vice. In troth, I think thou wouldst not. In troth, I think I should, and undo 't when I had done. Marry, I would not do such a thing for a joint-ring, nor measures of lawn, nor for gowns, petticoats, nor caps, nor any petty exhibition; but for the whole world, who would not make her husband a cuckold to make him a monarch? I should venture purgatory for 't. Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong For the whole world. Why, the wrong is but a wrong i' the world; and having the world for your labour, 'tis a wrong in your own world, and you might quickly make it right. I do not think there is any such woman. Yes, a dozen; and as many to the vantage, as would store the world they played for. But I do think it is their husbands' faults If wives do fall. Say that they slack their duties, And pour our treasures into foreign laps, Or else break out in peevish jealousies, Throwing restraint upon us; or, say they strike us, Or scant our former having in despite; Why, we have galls, and though we have some grace, Yet have we some revenge. Let husbands know Their wives have sense like them; they see and smell, And have their palates both for sweet and sour, As husbands have. What is it that they do When they change us for others? Is it sport? I think it is; and doth affection breed it? I think it doth: is 't frailty that thus errs? It is so too; and have not we affections, Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have? Then, let them use us well; else let them know, The ills we do, their ills instruct us so. Good night, good night; heaven me such usage send, Not to pick bad from bad, but by bad mend! Here, stand behind this bulk; straight will he come: Wear thy good rapier bare, and put it home. Quick, quick; fear nothing; I'll be at thy elbow. It makes us, or it mars us; think on that, And fix most firm thy resolution. Be near at hand; I may miscarry in 't. Here, at thy hand: be bold, and take thy stand. I have no great devotion to the deed; And yet he has given me satisfying reasons: 'Tis but a man gone: forth, my sword; he dies. I have rubb'd this young quat almost to the sense, And he grows angry. Now, whether he kill Cassio, Or Cassio him, or each do kill the other, Every way makes my gain: live Roderigo, He calls me to a restitution large Of gold and jewels that I bobb'd from him, As gifts to Desdemona; It must not be: if Cassio do remain, He hath a daily beauty in his life That makes me ugly; and, besides, the Moor May unfold me to him; there stand I in much peril. No, he must die. But so; I hear him coming. I know his gait; 'tis he. Villain, thou diest! That thrust had been mine enemy indeed But that my coat is better than thou know'st; I will make proof of thine. O! I am slain. I am maim'd for ever. Help, ho! murder! murder! The voice of Cassio: Iago keeps his word. O! villain that I am! It is e'en so. O, help, ho! light! a surgeon! 'Tis he: O brave Iago, honest and just! That hast such noble sense of thy friend's wrong; Thou teachest me. Minion, your dear lies dead, And your unblest fate hies; strumpet, I come! Forth of my heart those charms, thine eyes, are blotted; Thy bed lust-stain'd shall with lust's blood be spotted. What ho! no watch? no passage? murder! murder! 'Tis some mischance; the cry is very direful. O, help! Hark! O wretched villain! Two or three groan: it is a heavy night; These may be counterfeits; let's think 't unsafe To come in to the cry without more help. Nobody come? then shall I bleed to death. Hark! Here's one comes in his shirt, with light and weapons. Who's there? whose noise is this that cries on murder? We do not know. Did not you hear a cry? Here, here! for heaven's sake, help me. What's the matter? This is Othello's ancient, as I take it. The same indeed; a very valiant fellow. What are you here that cry so grievously? Iago? O! I am spoil'd, undone by villains! Give me some help. O me, lieutenant! what villains have done this? I think that one of them is hereabout, And cannot make away. O treacherous villains! What are you there? come in, and give some help. O! help me here. That's one of them. O murderous slave! O villain! O damn'd Iago! O inhuman dog! Kill men i' the dark! Where be these bloody thieves? How silent is this town! Ho! murder! murder! What may you be? are you of good or evil? As you shall prove us, praise us. Signior Lodovico? He, sir. I cry you mercy. Here's Cassio hurt by villains. Cassio! How is it, brother? My leg is cut in two. Marry, heaven forbid, Light, gentlemen; I'll bind it with my shirt. What is the matter, ho? who is 't that cried? Who is 't that cried! O my dear Cassio! my sweet Cassio! O Cassio, Cassio, Cassio! O notable strumpet! Cassio, may you suspect Who they should be that have thus mangled you? No. I am sorry to find you thus; I have been to seek you. Lend me a garter. So. O! for a chair, To bear him easily hence! Alas! he faints! O Cassio, Cassio, Cassio! Gentlemen all, I do suspect this trash To be a party in this injury. Patience awhile, good Cassio. Come, come. Lend me a light. Know we this face, or no? Alas! my friend and my dear countryman, Roderigo? no: yes, sure, O heaven! Roderigo. What! of Venice? Even he, sir: did you know him? Know him! ay. Signior Gratiano? I cry you gentle pardon; These bloody accidents must excuse my manners, That so neglected you. I am glad to see you. How do you, Cassio? O! a chair, a chair! Roderigo! He, he, 'tis he.â€”O! that's well said; the chair: Some good men bear him carefully from hence; I'll fetch the general's surgeon. For you, mistress, Save you your labour. He that lies slain here, Cassio, Was my dear friend. What malice was between you? None in the world; nor do I know the man. What! look you pale? O! bear him out o' the airâ€” Stay you, good gentlemen. Look you pale, mistress?â€” Do you perceive the gastness of her eye? Nay, if you stare, we shall hear more anon. Behold her well; I pray you, look upon her: Do you see, gentlemen? nay, guiltiness will speak Though tongues were out of use. 'Las! what's the matter? what's the matter, husband? Cassio hath here been set on in the dark By Roderigo and fellows that are 'scap'd: He's almost slain, and Roderigo dead. Alas! good gentleman; alas! good Cassio! This is the fruit of whoring. Prithee, Emilia, Go know of Cassio where he supp'd to-night. What! do you shake at that? He supp'd at my house; but I therefore shake not. O! did he so? I charge you, go with me. Fie, fie upon thee, strumpet! I am no strumpet, but of life as honest As you that thus abuse me. As I! foh! fie upon thee! Kind gentlemen, let's go see poor Cassio dress'd. Come, mistress, you must tell 's another tale. Emilia, run you to the citadel, And tell my lord and lady what hath happ'd. Will you go on afore? This is the night That either makes me or fordoes me quite. It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul; Let me not name it to you, you chaste stars! It is the cause. Yet I'll not shed her blood, Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow, And smooth as monumental alabaster. Yet she must die, else she'll betray more men. Put out the light, and then put out the light: If I quench thee, thou flaming minister, I can again thy former light restore, Should I repent me; but once put out thy light, Thou cunning'st pattern of excelling nature, I know not where is that Promethean heat That can thy light relume. When I have pluck'd the rose, I cannot give it vital growth again, It needs must wither: I'll smell it on the tree. O balmy breath, that dost almost persuade Justice to break her sword! One more, one more. Be thus when thou art dead, and I will kill thee, And love thee after. One more, and this the last: So sweet was ne'er so fatal. I must weep, But they are cruel tears; this sorrow's heavenly, It strikes where it doth love. She wakes. Who's there? Othello? Ay, Desdemona. Will you come to bed, my lord? Have you pray'd to-night, Desdemona? Ay, my lord. If you bethink yourself of any crime Unreconcil'd as yet to heaven and grace, Solicit for it straight. Alas! my lord, what may you mean by that? Well, do it, and be brief; I will walk by: I would not kill thy unprepared spirit; No; heaven forfend! I would not kill thy soul. Talk you of killing? Ay, I do. Then heaven Have mercy on me! Amen! with all my heart. If you say so, I hope you will not kill me. Hum! And yet I fear you; for you are fatal then When your eyes roll so. Why I should fear I know not, Since guiltiness I know not; but yet I feel I fear. Think on thy sins. They are loves I bear to you. Ay, and for that thou diest. That death's unnatural that kills for loving. Alas! why gnaw you so your nether lip? Some bloody passion shakes your very frame; These are portents, but yet, I hope, I hope They do not point on me. Peace, and be still! I will so. What's the matter? That handkerchief which I so lov'd and gave thee Thou gav'st to Cassio. No, by my life and soul! Send for the man and ask him. Sweet soul, take heed, Take heed of perjury; thou'rt on thy death-bed. Ay, but not yet to die. Yes, presently; Therefore confess thee freely of thy sin; For to deny each article with oath Cannot remove nor choke the strong conception That I do groan withal. Thou art to die. Then Lord have mercy on me! I say, amen. And have you mercy too! I never did Offend you in my life; never lov'd Cassio But with such general warranty of heaven As I might love; I never gave him token. By heaven, I saw my handkerchief in 's hand. O perjur'd woman! thou dost stone my heart, And mak'st me call what I intend to do A murder, which I thought a sacrifice: I saw the handkerchief. He found it then; I never gave it him. Send for him hither; Let him confess a truth. He hath confess'd. What, my lord? That he hath us'd thee. How? unlawfully? Ay. He will not say so. No; his mouth is stopp'd: Honest Iago hath ta'en order for 't. O! my fear interprets. What! is he dead? Had all his hairs been lives, my great revenge Had stomach for them all. Alas! he is betray'd and I undone. Out, strumpet! Weep'st thou for him to my face? O! banish me, my lord, but kill me not! Down, strumpet! Kill me to-morrow; let me live to-night! Nay, if you strive,â€” But half an hour! Being done, there is no pause. But while I say one prayer! It is too late. My lord, my lord! what, ho! my lord, my lord! What noise is this? Not dead? not yet quite dead? I that am cruel am yet merciful; I would not have thee linger in thy pain. So, so. What, ho! my lord, my lord! Who's there? O! good my lord, I would speak a word with you! Yes; 'tis Emilia: by and by. She's dead. 'Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio's death; The noise was high. Ha! no more moving? Still as the grave. Shall she come in? Were 't good? I think she stirs again: no. What's best to do? If she come in she'll sure speak to my wife: My wife! my wife! what wife? I have no wife: O, insupportable! O heavy hour! Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse Of sun and moon, and that the affrighted globe Should yawn at alteration. I do beseech you That I may speak with you, O! good my lord. I had forgot thee: O! come in, Emilia: Soft, by and by: let me the curtains draw. Where art thou? What's the matter with thee now? O! my good lord, yonder's foul murder done. What! now? But now, my lord. It is the very error of the moon; She comes more near the earth than she was wont, And makes men mad. Cassio, my lord, has kill'd a young Venetian Call'd Roderigo. Roderigo kill'd! And Cassio kill'd? No, Cassio is not kill'd. Not Cassio kill'd! then murder's out of tune, And sweet revenge grows harsh. O! falsely, falsely murder'd. Alas! what cry is that? That! what? Out, and alas! that was my lady's voice: Help! Help, ho! help! O lady, speak again! Sweet Desdemona! O! sweet mistress, speak. A guiltless death I die. O! who hath done this deed? Nobody; I myself; farewell: Commend me to my kind lord. O! farewell! Why, how should she be murder'd? Alas! who knows? You heard her say herself it was not I. She said so; I must needs report the truth. She's like a liar gone to burning hell; 'Twas I that kill'd her. O! the more angel she, And you the blacker devil. She turn'd to folly, and she was a whore. Thou dost belie her, and thou art a devil. She was false as water. Thou art rash as fire to say That she was false: O! she was heavenly true. Cassio did tup her; ask thy husband else. O! I were damn'd beneath all depth in bell But that I did proceed upon just grounds To this extremity. Thy husband knew it all. My husband! Thy husband. That she was false to wedlock? Ay, with Cassio. Nay, had she been true, If heaven would make me such another world Of one entire and perfect chrysolite, I'd not have sold her for it. My husband! Ay, 'twas he that told me first: An honest man he is, and hates the slime That sticks on filthy deeds. My husband! What needs this iterance, woman? I say thy husband. O mistress! villany hath made mocks with love. My husband say that she was false! He, woman; I say, thy husband: dost understand the word? My friend, thy husband, honest, honest Iago. If he say so, may his pernicious soul Rot half a grain a day! he lies to the heart: She was too fond of her most filthy bargain. Ha! Do thy worst: This deed of thine is no more worthy heaven Than thou wast worthy her. Peace! you were best. Thou hast not half the power to do me harm As I have to be hurt. O gull! O dolt! As ignorant as dirt! thou hast done a deed,â€” I care not for thy sword; I'll make thee known, Though I lost twenty lives. Help! help, ho! help! The Moor has kill'd my mistress! Murder! murder! What is the matter? How now, general! O! are you come, Iago? you have done well, That men must lay their murders on your neck. What is the matter? Disprove this villain if thou be'st a man: He says thou told'st him that his wife was false. I know thou didst not, thou'rt not such a villain, Speak, for my heart is full. I told him what I thought, and told no more Than what he found himself was apt and true. But did you ever tell him she was false? I did. You told a lie, an odious damned lie; Upon my soul, a lie, a wicked lie. She false with Cassio! Did you say with Cassio? With Cassio, mistress. Go to, charm your tongue. I will not charm my tongue; I am bound to speak. My mistress here lies murder'd in her bed. O heavens forfend! And your reports have set the murder on. Nay, stare not, masters; it is true, indeed. 'Tis a strange truth. O monstrous act! Villany! villany! villany! I think upon 't, I think, I smell 't; O villany! I thought so then; I'll kill myself for grief. O! villany, villany! What! are you mad? I charge you, get you home. Good gentlemen, let me have leave to speak: 'Tis proper I obey him, but not now. Perchance, Iago, I will ne'er go home. O! O! O! Nay, lay thee down and roar, For thou hast kill'd the sweetest innocent That e'er did lift up eye. O! she was foul. I scarce did know you, uncle. There lies your niece, Whose breath, indeed, these hands have newly stopp'd: I know this act shows terrible and grim. Poor Desdemona! I am glad thy father's dead. Thy match was mortal to him, and pure grief Shore his old thread in twain: did he live now, This sight would make him do a desperate turn, Yea, curse his better angel from his side, And fall to reprobation. 'Tis pitiful; but yet Iago knows That she with Cassio hath the act of shame A thousand times committed; Cassio confess'd it: And she did gratify his amorous works With that recognizance and pledge of love Which I first gave her. I saw it in his hand: It was a handkerchief, an antique token My father gave my mother. O heaven! O heavenly powers! Come, hold your peace. 'Twill out, 'twill out; I hold my peace, air? no; No, I will speak as liberal as the north; Let heaven and men and devils, let them all, All, all, cry shame against me, yet I'll speak. Be wise, and get you home. I will not. Fie! Your sword upon a woman? O thou dull Moor! that handkerchief thou speak'st of I found by fortune and did give my husband; For often, with a solemn earnestness, More than, indeed, belong'd to such a trifle, He begg'd of me to steal it. Villanous whore! She give it Cassio! no, alas! I found it, And I did give 't my husband. Filth, thou liest! By heaven, I do not, I do not, gentlemen. O murderous coxcomb! what should such a fool Do with so good a wife? Are there no stones in heaven But what serve for the thunder? Precious villain! The woman falls: sure, he has kill'd his wife. Ay, ay; O! lay me by my mistress' side. He's gone; but his wife's kill'd. 'Tis a notorious villain. Take you this weapon, Which I have here recover'd from the Moor. Come, guard the door without; let him not pass, But kill him rather. I'll after that same villain, For 'tis a damned slave. I am not valiant neither, But every puny whipster gets my sword. But why should honour outlive honesty? Let it go all. What did thy song bode, lady? Hark, canst thou hear me? I will play the swan, And die in music:â€” Willow, willow, willow. Moor, she was chaste; she lov'd thee, cruel Moor; So come my soul to bliss as I speak true; So speaking as I think, I die, I die. I have another weapon in this chamber; It is a sword of Spain, the ice brook's temper. O! here it is. Uncle, I must come forth. If thou attempt it, it will cost thee dear: Thou hast no weapon, and perforce must suffer. Look in upon me then, and speak with me, Or, naked as I am, I will assault thee. What is the matter? Behold! I have a weapon; A better never did itself sustain Upon a soldier's thigh: I have seen the day, That with this little arm, and this good sword, I have made my way through more impediments Than twenty times your stop: but, O vain boast! Who can control his fate? 'tis not so now. Be not afraid, though you do see me weapon'd; Here is my journey's end, here is my butt, And very sea-mark of my utmost sail. Do you go back dismay'd? 'tis a lost fear; Man but a rush against Othello's breast, And he retires. Where should Othello go? Now how dost thou look now? O ill-starr'd wench! Pale as thy smock! when we shall meet at compt, This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven, And fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my girl! Even like thy chastity. O! cursed, cursed slave. Whip me, ye devils, From the possession of this heavenly sight! Blow me about in winds! roast me in sulphur! Wash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire! O Desdemona! Desdemona! dead! Oh! Oh! Oh! Where is this rash and most unfortunate man? That's he that was Othello; here I am. Where is that viper? bring the villain forth. I look down towards his feet; but that's a fable. If that thou be'st a devil, I cannot kill thee. Wrench his sword from him. I bleed, sir; but not kill'd. I am not sorry neither; I'd have thee live; For, in my sense, 'tis happiness to die. O thou Othello! that wert once so good, Fall'n in the practice of a damned slave, What shall be said to thee? Why, any thing: An honourable murderer, if you will; For nought did I in hate, but all in honour. This wretch hath part confess'd his villany: Did you and he consent in Cassio's death? Ay. Dear general, I never gave you cause. I do believe it, and I ask your pardon. Will you, I pray, demand that demi-devil Why he hath thus ensnar'd my soul and body? Demand me nothing: what you know, you know: From this time forth I never will speak word. What! not to pray? Torments will ope your lips. Well, thou dost best. Sir, you shall understand what hath befall'n, Which, as I think, you know not. Here is a letter Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo, And here another; the one of them imports The death of Cassio to be undertook By Roderigo. O villain! Most heathenish and most gross! Now here's another discontented paper, Found in his pocket too; and this, it seems, Roderigo meant to have sent this damned villain, But that, belike, Iago in the interim Came in and satisfied him. O the pernicious caitiff! How came you, Cassio, by that handkerchief That was my wife's? I found it in my chamber; And he himself confess'd but even now That there he dropp'd it for a special purpose Which wrought to his desire. O fool! fool! fool! There is besides in Roderigo's letter How he upbraids Iago that he made him Brave me upon the watch; whereon it came That I was cast: and even but now he spake, After long seeming dead, Iago hurt him, Iago set him on. You must forsake this room and go with us; Your power and your command is taken off, And Cassio rules in Cyprus. For this slave, If there be any cunning cruelty That can torment him much and hold him long, It shall be his. You shall close prisoner rest. Till that the nature of your fault be known To the Venetian state. Come, bring him away. Soft you; a word or two before you go. I have done the state some service, and they know't; No more of that. I pray you, in your letters, When you shall these unlucky deeds relate, Speak of me as I am; nothing extenuate, Nor set down aught in malice: then, must you speak Of one that lov'd not wisely but too well; Of one not easily jealous, but, being wrought, Perplex'd in the extreme; of one whose hand, Like the base Indian, threw a pearl away Richer than all his tribe; of one whose subdu'd eyes Albeit unused to the melting mood, Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees Their med'cinable gum. Set you down this; And say besides, that in Aleppo once, Where a malignant and a turban'd Turk Beat a Venetian and traduc'd the state, I took by the throat the circumcised dog, And smote him thus. O bloody period! All that's spoke is marr'd. I kiss'd thee ere I kill'd thee; no way but this, Killing myself to die upon a kiss. This did I fear, but thought he had no weapon; For he was great of heart. O Spartan dog! More fell than anguish, hunger, or the sea. Look on the tragic loading of this bed; This is thy work; the object poisons sight; Let it be hid. Gratiano, keep the house, And seize upon the fortunes of the Moor, For they succeed on you. To you, lord governor, Remains the censure of this hellish villain, The time, the place, the torture; O! enforce it. Myself will straight aboard, and to the state This heavy act with heavy heart relate.\n"
